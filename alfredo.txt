This is a tried and true recipe and you will agree that it is the best recipe out there!\nThis is my most popular recipe for a good reason! If you love alfredo as much as I do try this Creamy Garlic Shrimp Alfredo Pasta , Instant Pot Chicken Alfredo Pasta or Asiago Garlic Alfredo Pasta .\u00a0\nAlfredo Sauce\nI just had to post my favorite alfredo recipe that I have created here on the blog.\nThere are a few secret ingredients that set it apart from all of the rest.\nIf there is one thing I can always count on my family to eat it is my homemade alfredo sauce over pasta.\nWe recently had some company over for\u00a0dinner and I made these Chicken Bacon Garlic Alfredo Roll Ups and they always are a huge hit!\nThis alfredo sauce is thick and creamy and the flavor is out of the world.\nIt is restaurant quality that you can make right at home!\nWhat is Alfredo Sauce\nClassic Alfredo Sauce is a simple but elegant creamy, white sauce that is commonly known to lay over pasta noodles.\nIt is made from butter, a type of cream and parmesan cheese.\nAdding seasonings and cream cheese for a thickener I like to blend a rich, creamy sauce together that is simple and irresistible.\nThe end result of this mixture is satisfying to say the least!\nWhat you need to make alfredo sauce\nSimple ingredients for an elegant sauce that is a classic dish loved by all.\nAlfredo Sauce just has a smooth, creamy texture that melts in your mouth.\nThe best results comes from the ingredients. Using the freshest ingredients is key!\nFresh parmesan cheese grated off the block is one of those key ingredients.\nThis will create a smooth textured sauce rather than a grainy one.\nEach of these ingredients melt and blend together so well creating a masterpiece!\nButter: either unsalted or salted work for this alfredo sauce recipe.\nHeavy whipping cream:\u00a0 for a richer and creamy flavor heavy whipping cream is preferred over whipping cream.\nCream cheese: this adds a nice thick consistency to your alfredo sauce.\nMinced garlic: for best flavoring use fresh garlic and mince it the best you can.\nGarlic powder: adds to the rich and garlic flavoring.\nItalian seasoning: brings on an Italian fill and blends all the seasonings together.\nSalt and pepper: just to taste!\nGrated parmesan cheese: using real parmesan cheese is best. Powdered cheese will create a grainy texture and does not melt through when heated.\nHow to make Alfredo sauce\nCreating this master piece does take a little bit of time. We all know that it is worth it!\nWe love Alfredo sauce and it is a quick and easy sauce that can be made in minutes with these simple ingredients.\nEnjoy alfredo sauce right when you need it!\nWhisk dairy ingredients together: In a medium saucepan add butter, heavy whipping cream, and cream cheese. Cook over medium heat and whisk until melted.\nAdd and whisk seasonings:\u00a0 Add the minced garlic, garlic powder, italian seasoning, salt and pepper. Continue to whisk until smooth.\nStir in cheese:\u00a0 Add the grated parmesan cheese.\nThicken your sauce:\u00a0 Bring to a simmer and continue to cook for about 3-5 minutes or until it starts to thicken.\nToss with pasta:\u00a0 Toss it with your favorite pasta!\nIs Alfredo Sauce keto?\nYes! This is totally keto! I left out the flour and that makes this keto.\nCrazy, I know! But such good news!\nIf you are following a low carb diet this can be a great recipe to enjoy while cutting back on other favorite meals.\nEven though it is keto and considered a low carb recipe, it is still full on creamy, thick and rich alfredo sauce.\nIt will be like dessert in your mouth!\nThis easy to make Alfredo Sauce recipe will have you saying MMMMM and AWW, with every bite.\nFAQ\u2019s for making Alfredo Sauce\nThis alfredo sauce has delicious garlic flavor and Italian seasonings.\nI like to add cream cheese to my alfredo for that extra creamy flavor and texture.\nThis alfredo sauce always gets raved about whenever I make it!\nHow to make\u00a0Alfredo Sauce with milk instead cream?\nAdding milk is always an option. This will be a lighter and less thick consistency but can work. Half and half is also another option instead of heavy whipping cream. To thicken it up a little more adding 1 to 2 teaspoons of flour to thicken.\nHow to make\u00a0Alfredo\u00a0Sauce thicker?\nWhen adding cream cheese, slowly cut chunks of cream cheese as you are stirring. This helps create a thicker and creamier sauce. You can also use a roux by using an equal amount of butter to flour, about 1 teaspoon.\nIs\u00a0Alfredo Sauce gluten free?\nThis recipe is considered gluten free! It still has a great taste and all the fresh ingredients to make this just the way you like it with no substitutions.\nIs Alfredo Sauce cheese?\nThis is a cheese based sauce that is rich in flavor. It does not harden like a cheese though.\nDoes Alfredo\u00a0sauce have dairy?\nThere are substitutions to make this dairy free but I do not recommend it if you are looking for the authentic taste of Alfredo Sauce. Having dairy in this Alfredo Sauce recipe makes this rich, creamy and smooth when simmering.\nIs Alfredo Sauce good with ground beef?\u00a0\nIt can be done, but not recommended. Alfredo sauce goes best with a chicken, fish or pasta.\nHow Many Cups Does this Yield?\nWhen you are done making your Alfredo Sauce you will be able to fill a tall canning jar. This is about 14 to 16 ounces (1 pound) of pasta or 2 cups of sauce. We like to reserve a little alfredo sauce on the side for dipping.\u00a0\nTips for making Alfredo Sauce\nI think this sauce is even better than any restaurant that I have been to and the best part is that you can make it yourself!\nIt is thick, creamy, and rich and the perfect sauce on top of your favorite pasta.\nI know that you will quickly agree that this is the BEST!\nThis will be a recipe that you make again and again, just like I do!\nSlowly add in your heavy whipping cream and cream cheese. This will enhance your flavors as well as thicken evenly throughout.\nAvoid separating your Alfredo Sauce when mixing it by whisking it together rather than stirring with a spatula.\nParmesan cheese is the key ingredient for making this Alfredo Sauce thick and creamy. I recommend using a fresh parmesan cheese that you grate yourself or similar. Try to avoid using the powder or grated grated parmesan cheese in a tall can.\nThe most important rule is not overheating your Alfredo Sauce. Slowly add ingredients on a low and for a short period of time. Melted cheese will break and separate once it gets too hot leaving your cheese clumpy.\nWhen simmering, a shorter amount of time is best. Around 1 minute, whisking it well.\nDo not boil or overheat. Boiling will separate and ruin the alfredo sauce.\nIf you are worried about overheating, add your parmesan with the heat off. This will also precent clumping and separating the alfredo sauce.\nVariations of alfredo sauce\nThere are many variations that can be done with Alfredo Sauce recipe.\nAdding thickeners or making it more creamy and watery are great ways to adjust this Alfredo Sauce.\nSubstituting any dairy or cheese can have major changes to this alfredo sauce recipe though.\nFor best results, enjoy my delicious Alfredo Sauce recipe that is definitely a tried and true recipe that is pure perfection!\nHalf and half or milk is great to substitute the heavy whipping cream.\nGrilled chicken, shredding rotisserie chicken or shrimp goes well with pasta.\nAdd in more spices and seasonings like red pepper flakes or paprika for a sweeter and spicier Alfredo Sauce like this\u00a0 One Pot Cajun Chicken Alfredo Pasta .\nUse half Romano cheese or asiago cheese instead of parmesan cheese.\nMaking your own fresh pasta instead of dry pasta tastes even more amazing.\nWays to use Alfredo Sauce\nThis alfredo sauce recipe comes together pretty easily and you will never go back to the jarred alfredo sauce again! \u00a0\nIt is awesome on top of just about any pasta but is also delicious used as a dip or even spread on pizza .\nYou can\u2019t go wrong where you add your Alfredo Sauce to!\nPasta : Any pasta is great with Alfredo Sauce. The thicker and larger is best to soak up the rich, thick and creamy sauce.\nPizza: \u00a0Alfredo pizza is one of our favorites. We love the fresh and lighter taste this sauce has to offer. This Chicken Alfredo Pizza is a great use of Alfredo Sauce recipe. Making my Quick and Easy Dough \u00a0for the crust is a great combination too.\nDipping: \u00a0We love to dip breadsticks or Miracle No Knead Bread . It is always so delicious and almost addicting it is so good!\nCasserole: \u00a0I have several casserole dishes that work so well with this alfredo sauce. It is easy to make and add to a simple casserole. Try this Pesto Alfredo Chicken Casserole for your next main meal!\nWhat to make with Alfredo Sauce\nAlfredo sauce is a family favorite over here.\nI know that I can make so many delicious recipes with this Alfredo Sauce.\nSimple and basic recipes to a little more complex, this Alfredo Sauce recipe just does the trick!\nMake this a complete meal with a few vegetables, garlic bread and a side salad.\nGrilled Asparagus\nParmesan Roasted Vegetables\u00a0\nThree Cheese Garlic Pull Apart Bread\nChilled Cucumber Tomato Salad\nSkillet Potatoes with Peppers\nHow to store alfredo sauce\nTo make the perfect blend of Alfredo Sauce you will want to watch your cooking temperature and stirring well.\nThis will make the perfect alfredo sauce and reheating just a breeze.\nAlfredo Sauce is a favorite in our home and I know that it does not last long, even if I double it!\nEnjoy your Alfredo Sauce again and again when storing it properly.\nHow long does Alfredo sauce last in the fridge: I like to pour my Alfredo Sauce in a jar and sealed in the refrigerator. For best results and continued flavoring it will last in the fridge for about 5 days.\nCan you freeze Alfredo\u00a0Sauce: Unfortunately this Alfredo Sauce does not freeze well. Because of the freshness of it, it will separate when freezing.\nHow to heat up Alfredo sauce: Slowly, is the key! Slow, low temperatures and stirring often. If it starts to separate, slowly stir it back together over low heat on the stove top. It is best not to microwave this sauce. It becomes more oily and separates just as easily, if not more. Once reheated, do not reheat again.\nMore delicious recipes using alfredo sauce\nAlfredo Pesto Tortellini with Sausage\u00a0\nChicken Broccoli Garlic Alfredo Shells\nBacon Chicken Alfredo Pizza\nSkinny Fettuccini Garlic Alfredo\u00a0\nThree Cheese Chicken Broccoli Alfredo\u00a0\nThe Best Homemade Alfredo Sauce Ever!\n4.9 from 473 votes\nPrep Time\n10\nminutes\nCook Time\n5\nminutes\nTotal Time\n15\nminutes\nAuthor\nAlyssa Rivers\nServings\n10\nservings\nPrint\nReview\nAlfredo\u00a0Sauce is the most creamy and delicious homemade alfredo sauce that you will ever make! \u00a0 This is a tried and true recipe and you will agree that it is the best recipe out there!\nCourse\nDinner, Main Course\nCuisine\nItalian\nIngredients\n\u00bd\ncup\nbutter\n1\npint\nheavy whipping cream\n2 cups\n4\nounces\ncream cheese\n\u00bd\nteaspoon\nminced garlic\n1\nteaspoon\ngarlic powder\n1\nteaspoon\nitalian seasoning\n\u00bc\nteaspoon\nsalt\n\u00bc\nteaspoon\npepper\n1\ncup\ngrated parmesan cheese\nInstructions\nIn a medium saucepan add butter, heavy whipping cream, and cream cheese.

I had a gritty texture but mixed with pasta and veggies it was fabulous\nReply\nJim Rossi\nsays:\nMarch 27, 2020 at 6:45 am\nTry grated Parmesan, or better yet, Pecorino Romano. I\u2019ve been making fettuccine Alfredo for about 40 years, and this is very similar to the one I learned when I was 16 working at an Italian restaurant. The biggest thing that I can tell everyone is to watch your heat, you\u2019ll curdle the cream and butter with too high of a heat, so keep it down and continue to stir or whisk until everything is incorporated and melted as Allyssa said. The original Alfredo does not have garlic, but I have always added garlic as she does. I haven\u2019t added cream cheese yet, so I think I\u2019ll try it! One last thought, maybe the Italian seasoning is adding the grit? I\u2019ve never added that before, just ground pepper, as the cheese has enough salt to carry it through.\nReply\nMax\nsays:\nMarch 27, 2020 at 5:52 pm\nThe tips and recipe for this Alfredo Sauce are absolutely the best. I want to marry you. Oh, I already have the perfect wife. Seriously you are a Saint.\nReply\nRay Francis\nsays:\nMarch 27, 2020 at 11:43 pm\nYou\u2019re the best indeed! I followed your Recipe for making Alfredo sauce with a twist since I used part pecorino cheese and of course, parmesan cheese. I also used half of the cream cheese block with Irish butter. I used the sauce for seafood fetucini. It is an awesome treat, thanks to you, Alyssa!\nReply\nTina\nsays:\nMarch 29, 2020 at 7:33 pm\nMy goodness. Made this for the first time tonite. Followed the recipe exactly, simple to put together but soooo delicious and rich. Used it over spinach fettuccine, slices of Beyond Sausage, saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, and some broccoli. The sauce was perfect, better than in a restaurant. My husband couldn\u2019t get enough of it, he loved it. Thank you for this wonderful recipe! \ud83d\ude0b\nReply\nRay Francis\nsays:\nMarch 27, 2020 at 11:47 pm\nYou\u2019re the best indeed!

I always get compliments on it! Thank you.\nReply\nDon Spencer\nsays:\nMarch 29, 2020 at 9:53 pm\nSorry but I found this sauce far too thick. But thank you you pointed me in the right direction. Actually found it still a bit thick even after omitting the cream cheese but adding just a bit of 3% milk got it right were I wanted it. Probably less than a quarter cup. Sorry didnt measure. The result. Fabulous !!!\nReply\nChristy\nsays:\nMarch 30, 2020 at 8:59 am\nThis is my go-to recipe for Alfredo that I have been using for years. Not sure where I first saw it. I usually use salted butter and increase the salt to 1/2 tsp. I found it bland if I followed the original recipe. I also usually add more Parmesan than the recipe calls for. This helps thicken it more and gives it more cheesy flavor.\nReply\nAmanda Dawn\nsays:\nMarch 30, 2020 at 6:49 pm\nRoughly how much in ounces does 1 batch make? I\u2019m trying to make this bulk to can it.\nReply\nAlyssa Rivers\nsays:\nApril 5, 2020 at 4:42 pm\nAbout 16 ounces, a jar full.\nReply\nVanessa\nsays:\nApril 1, 2020 at 9:34 am\nBest Alfredo sauce! Most I have made are very bland and don\u2019t have much flavor. Even my hard to please husband really liked it. I\u2019ll use this again! Maybe add chicken or lobster. I used it over ravioli and loved it.\nReply\nMalissa\nsays:\nApril 1, 2020 at 9:24 pm\nI grew up on Alfredo sauce made from packets and I will never go back to them! This recipe is very simple, fast & delicious. My whole family absolutely loves it. I\u2019ve never made it using cream though, I\u2019ve used whole milk and other times I\u2019ve used half and half. it\u2019s obviously much thinner using milk, but it tastes so good we don\u2019t mind. Plus there\u2019s always left overs & by the next day the sauce absorbs & thickens. I\u2019ve tried a few other Alfredo recipes and was always disappointed. This one has so much flavor. Try it, you won\u2019t regret it.\nReply\nJill schenck\nsays:\nApril 2, 2020 at 8:07 am\nThe name for this Alfredo sauce is spot on!! It is THE best Alfredo sauce ever! I\u2019ve been making this for my family for about a year and they absolutely love it. This last time I found some homemade fettuccine noodles, and it was amazing. Thank you soooooo much for sharing this award winning recipe!\nReply\nRick\nsays:\nApril 3, 2020 at 3:05 pm\nBeen making this recipe for a while. I use light cream and a little less cream cheese . I also saut\u00e9s baby Bella mushrooms and add ham cut into very tiny cubes and add to recipe . My family can\u2019t get enough.\nReply\nSteve\nsays:\nApril 5, 2020 at 10:44 am\nI made this for my Granddaughter\u2019s 21st Birthday dinner\u2026.she loves Alfredo! I prepared some with saut\u00e9ed chicken and some with saut\u00e9ed shrimp and the family absolutely loved it! The only change I made was using a creamier European butter. Thank you! It was out of this world!\nReply\nCatherine\nsays:\nApril 9, 2020 at 8:11 pm\nWill never order Alfredo sauce from a restaurant again. This is better, and so easy. So happy I found this website! Will try shrimp and grits next.\nReply\nTony Sandrin\nsays:\nApril 11, 2020 at 5:36 am\nHi,\nWe just love this sauce. I recently started making my own pasta as well. My adult kids have asked for the recipie and I refuse to give it to them for FEAR of not being invited back for supper again LOL.\nI was wondering if you can double this recipe or it best to make one batch at a time.\nReply\nSadia\nsays:\nApril 11, 2020 at 6:52 pm\nI never leave reviews but I had to for this one. This is by far the best tasting Alfredo recipe. My whole family loves it even my picky two year old. Thank you for such a great recipe.\nReply\nJenna\nsays:\nApril 12, 2020 at 6:45 pm\nThis recipe was excellent! My husband and kids are SUPER picky and they all loved it!! Thank you \ud83d\ude42 I will definitely make this again\nReply\nTony Sandrin\nsays:\nApril 15, 2020 at 6:41 am\nHi,\nI love this sauce and wouldn\u2019t change it for the world. Your right , reheating on high separates the cream and tastes like hell.\nI need your expertise .\n\u2026 I plan to make fresh home made cannelloni and it calls for a mixture of Alfredo sauce and tomato sauce as a topping. Im wondering if this recipe will separate the cream if I bake it ? Would substituting 1/2 & 1/2 resolve this issue . Thanks\nTony\nReply\nTiffany\nsays:\nApril 15, 2020 at 6:10 pm\nThe star rating isn\u2019t working,anyway, this is great! Easy and tastes fantastic!! Thank you for sharing I will Be making this again and again.\nReply\nJeff Winett\nsays:\nApril 16, 2020 at 9:12 am\nAdd me to the growing legion as a fan of your recipe. For way too long I would strictly follow the recipes that were touted as being the ONLY authentic Alfredo\u2026.the ones where you just emulsify butter with high quality Parmesan. These pastas were good enough, but never gave me the same feelings as when I was a kid, enjoying restaurant Fettuccine Alfredo. I made your recipe for the first time last night, and instantly, I was that happy kid again. Let anyone say that \u201ccream cheese\u201d is totally a no-no for true Alfredo\u2026I believe this allows the sauce to remain creamy and emulsified. Anyway, last night I mixed in some cooked chicken thigh, and was in heaven. My next iteration will be your sauce, and then shower crispy bacon over the dish. Thank you, thank you, thank you for this!\nReply\njoyce\nsays:\nApril 16, 2020 at 11:14 am\nI tried it this past weekend. It is indeed\u2026hands down\u2026the best alfredo sauce I\u2019ve ever tasted. My daughter wanted chicken in it for her birthday, but it didn\u2019t need anything in it. Just a vegetable or a salad and garlic bread if you want to. Broccoli would be a good vegetable. Thank you so much for sharing.\nReply\nSean\nsays:\nApril 17, 2020 at 3:59 am\nI made this last night..Amazing is all I have to say\u2026best recipe..ever\nReply\nBrandy\nsays:\nApril 19, 2020 at 9:59 pm\nI have been using this recipe for a while now.

[1] It has been operating since 1914 and is known as the birthplace of Fettuccine Alfredo .

[2] According to family accounts, in 1892 Alfredo Di Lelio began to work in a restaurant that was located in piazza Rosa and run by his mother Angelina. Di Lelio invented \"fettuccine al triplo burro\" [3] (later named \"fettuccine all'Alfredo\" or \"fettuccine Alfredo\") in 1907 or 1908, while running an oil and wine shop, in an effort to entice his wife, Ines, to eat after giving birth to their first child Armando. Alfredo added extra butter or \"triplo burro\u201d to the fettuccine when mixing it together for her. [4] [5] [6]\nIn 1914, Di Lelio converted the oil and wine shop into the restaurant, then called \"Alfredo\", on the via della Scrofa in central Rome. [7] In 1943, Di Lelio sold the restaurant to the family of the current owners. In 1950 Alfredo Di Lelio decided to reopen with his son Armando his restaurant in Piazza Augusto Imperatore n.30 \"Il Vero Alfredo\" (\u201cAlfredo di Roma\u201d), that is always operational, managed by Alfredo Di Lelio's family.\nReferences [ edit ]\n^\nLaurie Bogart Morrow (9 October 2012).

[3] [4] [5] As the cheese melts, it emulsifies the liquids to form a smooth and rich sauce coating the pasta. [3] The dish is named after Alfredo di Lelio, who featured the dish at his restaurant in Rome in the early- to mid-20th century; the \"ceremony\" of preparing it tableside was an integral part of the dish. [3] [6]\nThe dish became popularized and eventually spread to the United States, where it remains popular. The recipe has evolved, and its commercialized version\u2014with heavy cream and other ingredients\u2014is now ubiquitous. In the U.S., however, it is often served as a main course , sometimes garnished with chicken or other ingredients. In Italy, meanwhile, fettuccine al burro is generally considered home cooking , in contrast to fettuccine Alfredo , a very rich version of the dish. [6]\nContents\n1\nHistory\n2\nPreparation\n3\nIn the United States\n4\nAlfredo sauce\n5\nSee also\n6\nReferences\n7\nSources\n8\nExternal links\nHistory [ edit ]\nServing fettuccine with butter and cheese was first mentioned in a 15th-century recipe for maccaroni romaneschi ('Roman pasta') by Martino da Como , a northern Italian cook active in Rome; the recipe cooks the noodles in broth or water and adds butter, \"good cheese\" (the variety is not specified) and \"sweet spices\". [7]\nModern fettuccine Alfredo was invented by Alfredo di Lelio in Rome. According to family accounts, in 1892 Alfredo di Lelio began to work in a restaurant that was located in piazza Rosa and run by his mother Angelina. Di Lelio invented \"fettuccine al triplo burro\" [3] (later named \"fettuccine all'Alfredo\" or \"fettuccine Alfredo\") in 1907 or 1908 in an effort to entice his wife, Ines, to eat after giving birth to their first child Armando. Alfredo added extra butter or \"triplo burro\u201d to the fettuccine when mixing it together for her. [8] [9] [10] Piazza Rosa disappeared in 1910 following the construction of the Galleria Colonna/Sordi and the restaurant was forced to close. Di Lelio later opened his own restaurant, Alfredo alla Scrofa then called \"Alfredo\", in 1914 on the via della Scrofa in central Rome.\nThe fame of Alfredo's fettuccine spread, first in Rome and then to other countries. Di Lelio was made a Cavaliere dell'Ordine della Corona d'Italia . [11] [12]\nIn 1943, during the war, di Lelio sold the restaurant to two of his waiters. [13] In 1950, with his son Armando, Alfredo di Lelio opened a new restaurant in piazza Augusto Imperatore, Alfredo all'Augusteo, now managed by his niece Ines Di Lelio, bringing along the famous \"gold cutlery\" [3] said to have been donated in 1927 by the American actors Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks in gratitude for Alfredo's hospitality. The two restaurants competed vigorously, with escalating puffery: \"the king of fettuccine\", \"the real king of fettuccine\", \"the magician of fettuccine\", \"the emperor of fettuccine\", \"the real Alfredo\", etc. [13]\nPreparation [ edit ]\nThe dish was so well known that di Lelio was invited to demonstrate it both in Italy and abroad. [13] The fame of the dish, called on Alfredo's menus maestosissime fettuccine all'Alfredo 'most majestic fettuccine, Alfredo style', comes largely from the \"spectacle reminiscent of grand opera\" of its preparation at table, [4] as described in 1967:\n[The fettuccine] are seasoned with plenty of butter and fat parmesan, not aged, so that, in a ritual of extraordinary theatricality, the owner mixes the pasta and lifts it high to serve it, the white threads of cheese gilded with butter and the bright yellow of the ribbons of egg pasta offering an eyeful for the customer; at the end of the ceremony, the guest of honor is presented the golden cutlery and the serving dish, where the blond fettuccine roll around in the pale gold of the seasonings. It's worth seeing the whole ceremony. The owner, son of old Alfredo and looking exactly like him, ... bends over the great skein of fettuccine, fixes it intensely, his eyes half-closed, and dives into mixing it, waving the golden cutlery with grand gestures, like an orchestra conductor, with his sinister upwards-pointing twirled moustache dancing up and down, pinkies in the air, a rapt gaze, flailing elbows. [13]\nRecipes attributed to Alfredo only include three ingredients: fettuccine, young Parmesan cheese and butter. [11] [14] [13] Yet there are various legends about the \"secret\" of the original Alfredo recipe: some say oil is added to the pasta dough, others that the noodles are cooked in milk. [15] The secret may in fact be simply that the noodles, cheese and butter are tossed constantly with some pasta water in a well-warmed platter to ensure that they melt together thoroughly. [16]\nFettuccine Alfredo, minus the spectacle, has now become ubiquitous in Italian-style restaurants outside Italy, although in Italy this dish is usually called simply \"fettuccine al burro\". [5] [17]\nIn the United States [ edit ]\n\u201c\nThis act of mixing the butter and cheese through the noodles becomes quite a ceremony when performed by Alfredo in his tiny restaurant in Rome. As busy as Alfredo is with other duties, he manages to be at each table when the waiter arrives with the platter of fettuccine to be mixed by him. As a violinist plays inspiring music, Alfredo performs the sacred ceremony with a fork and spoon of solid gold. Alfredo does not cook noodles. He does not make noodles. He achieves them.\n\u201d\n\u2014\u00a0 George Rector (1933) [18]\nAlfredo's fettuccine has long been popular with Americans. By 1922, it was already being reported on by American travelers. [19] Multiple magazine articles and guidebooks in the 1920s and 1930s extolled Alfredo's noodles. [12] [20] [14] In 1927, Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks supposedly dined at Alfredo's and gave him the famous gold fork and spoon. [14] Also in 1927, the American restaurateur and writer George Rector wrote up Alfredo's fettuccine and described the ceremony of its tableside preparation, accompanied by violin music, in detail; he did not give it a specific name, nor mention golden tableware. [11]\nIn the 1950s, di Lelio promoted the dish and his restaurant by putting up photos of visiting celebrities with his noodles, including Jimmy Stewart , Bob Hope , Anthony Quinn , Bing Crosby , Gary Cooper , Jack Lemmon , Ava Gardner , Tyrone Power , Sophia Loren , Cantinflas , and many others. [21]\nIn 1966, the Pennsylvania Dutch Noodle Company started marketing their dried \"Fettuccine Egg Noodles\", which included a recipe on the package for an Alfredo sauce including cream and Swiss cheese as well as Parmesan and butter. [16]\nThe American restaurant casual dining chain Olive Garden has popularized its versions of fettuccine alfredo , which may be combined with chicken, shrimp, or other foods to make main courses called \"chicken alfredo\", \"seafood alfredo\", etc. Given the strict separation of pasta and meat dishes in the usual Italian restaurant cuisine , this was never done by di Lelio. Olive Garden's recipe also includes cream and garlic. [22]\nAlfredo sauce [ edit ]\nAlfredo sauce is often sold as a convenience food in grocery stores in many countries. Unlike the original preparation, which is thickened only by cheese, the prepared food and fast food [23] versions of Alfredo may be thickened with eggs or starch .\nSee also [ edit ]\nFood portal\nList of foods named after people\nList of pasta dishes\nReferences [ edit ]\n^\n\"fettuccine\" at Collins Dictionary , accessed 2016-11-22 ( archive )\n^\nAmore, Katia (2014-10-13). \"Fettuccine al Burro or Fettuccine Alfredo\" .

[3] [4] [5] As the cheese melts, it emulsifies the liquids to form a smooth and rich sauce coating the pasta.

The recipe has evolved, and its commercialized version\u2014with heavy cream and other ingredients\u2014is now ubiquitous. In the U.S., however, it is often served as a main course , sometimes garnished with chicken or other ingredients. In Italy, meanwhile, fettuccine al burro is generally considered home cooking , in contrast to fettuccine Alfredo , a very rich version of the dish.

[7]\nModern fettuccine Alfredo was invented by Alfredo di Lelio in Rome. According to family accounts, in 1892 Alfredo di Lelio began to work in a restaurant that was located in piazza Rosa and run by his mother Angelina. Di Lelio invented \"fettuccine al triplo burro\" [3] (later named \"fettuccine all'Alfredo\" or \"fettuccine Alfredo\") in 1907 or 1908 in an effort to entice his wife, Ines, to eat after giving birth to their first child Armando. Alfredo added extra butter or \"triplo burro\u201d to the fettuccine when mixing it together for her. [8] [9] [10] Piazza Rosa disappeared in 1910 following the construction of the Galleria Colonna/Sordi and the restaurant was forced to close. Di Lelio later opened his own restaurant, Alfredo alla Scrofa then called \"Alfredo\", in 1914 on the via della Scrofa in central Rome.\nThe fame of Alfredo's fettuccine spread, first in Rome and then to other countries. Di Lelio was made a Cavaliere dell'Ordine della Corona d'Italia . [11] [12]\nIn 1943, during the war, di Lelio sold the restaurant to two of his waiters. [13] In 1950, with his son Armando, Alfredo di Lelio opened a new restaurant in piazza Augusto Imperatore, Alfredo all'Augusteo, now managed by his niece Ines Di Lelio, bringing along the famous \"gold cutlery\" [3] said to have been donated in 1927 by the American actors Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks in gratitude for Alfredo's hospitality. The two restaurants competed vigorously, with escalating puffery: \"the king of fettuccine\", \"the real king of fettuccine\", \"the magician of fettuccine\", \"the emperor of fettuccine\", \"the real Alfredo\", etc. [13]\nPreparation [ edit ]\nThe dish was so well known that di Lelio was invited to demonstrate it both in Italy and abroad. [13] The fame of the dish, called on Alfredo's menus maestosissime fettuccine all'Alfredo 'most majestic fettuccine, Alfredo style', comes largely from the \"spectacle reminiscent of grand opera\" of its preparation at table, [4] as described in 1967:\n[The fettuccine] are seasoned with plenty of butter and fat parmesan, not aged, so that, in a ritual of extraordinary theatricality, the owner mixes the pasta and lifts it high to serve it, the white threads of cheese gilded with butter and the bright yellow of the ribbons of egg pasta offering an eyeful for the customer; at the end of the ceremony, the guest of honor is presented the golden cutlery and the serving dish, where the blond fettuccine roll around in the pale gold of the seasonings. It's worth seeing the whole ceremony. The owner, son of old Alfredo and looking exactly like him, ... bends over the great skein of fettuccine, fixes it intensely, his eyes half-closed, and dives into mixing it, waving the golden cutlery with grand gestures, like an orchestra conductor, with his sinister upwards-pointing twirled moustache dancing up and down, pinkies in the air, a rapt gaze, flailing elbows. [13]\nRecipes attributed to Alfredo only include three ingredients: fettuccine, young Parmesan cheese and butter. [11] [14] [13] Yet there are various legends about the \"secret\" of the original Alfredo recipe: some say oil is added to the pasta dough, others that the noodles are cooked in milk. [15] The secret may in fact be simply that the noodles, cheese and butter are tossed constantly with some pasta water in a well-warmed platter to ensure that they melt together thoroughly. [16]\nFettuccine Alfredo, minus the spectacle, has now become ubiquitous in Italian-style restaurants outside Italy, although in Italy this dish is usually called simply \"fettuccine al burro\". [5] [17]\nIn the United States [ edit ]\n\u201c\nThis act of mixing the butter and cheese through the noodles becomes quite a ceremony when performed by Alfredo in his tiny restaurant in Rome. As busy as Alfredo is with other duties, he manages to be at each table when the waiter arrives with the platter of fettuccine to be mixed by him. As a violinist plays inspiring music, Alfredo performs the sacred ceremony with a fork and spoon of solid gold. Alfredo does not cook noodles. He does not make noodles. He achieves them.\n\u201d\n\u2014\u00a0 George Rector (1933) [18]\nAlfredo's fettuccine has long been popular with Americans. By 1922, it was already being reported on by American travelers. [19] Multiple magazine articles and guidebooks in the 1920s and 1930s extolled Alfredo's noodles. [12] [20] [14] In 1927, Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks supposedly dined at Alfredo's and gave him the famous gold fork and spoon. [14] Also in 1927, the American restaurateur and writer George Rector wrote up Alfredo's fettuccine and described the ceremony of its tableside preparation, accompanied by violin music, in detail; he did not give it a specific name, nor mention golden tableware. [11]\nIn the 1950s, di Lelio promoted the dish and his restaurant by putting up photos of visiting celebrities with his noodles, including Jimmy Stewart , Bob Hope , Anthony Quinn , Bing Crosby , Gary Cooper , Jack Lemmon , Ava Gardner , Tyrone Power , Sophia Loren , Cantinflas , and many others. [21]\nIn 1966, the Pennsylvania Dutch Noodle Company started marketing their dried \"Fettuccine Egg Noodles\", which included a recipe on the package for an Alfredo sauce including cream and Swiss cheese as well as Parmesan and butter. [16]\nThe American restaurant casual dining chain Olive Garden has popularized its versions of fettuccine alfredo , which may be combined with chicken, shrimp, or other foods to make main courses called \"chicken alfredo\", \"seafood alfredo\", etc. Given the strict separation of pasta and meat dishes in the usual Italian restaurant cuisine , this was never done by di Lelio. Olive Garden's recipe also includes cream and garlic. [22]\nAlfredo sauce [ edit ]\nAlfredo sauce is often sold as a convenience food in grocery stores in many countries. Unlike the original preparation, which is thickened only by cheese, the prepared food and fast food [23] versions of Alfredo may be thickened with eggs or starch .\nSee also [ edit ]\nFood portal\nList of foods named after people\nList of pasta dishes\nReferences [ edit ]\n^\n\"fettuccine\" at Collins Dictionary , accessed 2016-11-22 ( archive )\n^\nAmore, Katia (2014-10-13). \"Fettuccine al Burro or Fettuccine Alfredo\" .

[14] Also in 1927, the American restaurateur and writer George Rector wrote up Alfredo's fettuccine and described the ceremony of its tableside preparation, accompanied by violin music, in detail; he did not give it a specific name, nor mention golden tableware. [11]\nIn the 1950s, di Lelio promoted the dish and his restaurant by putting up photos of visiting celebrities with his noodles, including Jimmy Stewart , Bob Hope , Anthony Quinn , Bing Crosby , Gary Cooper , Jack Lemmon , Ava Gardner , Tyrone Power , Sophia Loren , Cantinflas , and many others. [21]\nIn 1966, the Pennsylvania Dutch Noodle Company started marketing their dried \"Fettuccine Egg Noodles\", which included a recipe on the package for an Alfredo sauce including cream and Swiss cheese as well as Parmesan and butter. [16]\nThe American restaurant casual dining chain Olive Garden has popularized its versions of fettuccine alfredo , which may be combined with chicken, shrimp, or other foods to make main courses called \"chicken alfredo\", \"seafood alfredo\", etc. Given the strict separation of pasta and meat dishes in the usual Italian restaurant cuisine , this was never done by di Lelio. Olive Garden's recipe also includes cream and garlic. [22]\nAlfredo sauce [ edit ]\nAlfredo sauce is often sold as a convenience food in grocery stores in many countries. Unlike the original preparation, which is thickened only by cheese, the prepared food and fast food [23] versions of Alfredo may be thickened with eggs or starch .\nSee also [ edit ]\nFood portal\nList of foods named after people\nList of pasta dishes\nReferences [ edit ]\n^\n\"fettuccine\" at Collins Dictionary , accessed 2016-11-22 ( archive )\n^\nAmore, Katia (2014-10-13). \"Fettuccine al Burro or Fettuccine Alfredo\" .

Please read my disclosure policy .\nMy favorite recipe for homemade Alfredo sauce.\u00a0 It\u2019s easy to make in just 15 minutes, full of the best creamy and garlicky flavors, and always ultra comforting and delicious.\nAfter sharing my favorite marinara sauce recipe with you yesterday, today I\u2019m sharing my go-to recipe for its creamy, cheesy, ultra-comforting counterpart\u2026\n\u2026my favorite homemade Alfredo sauce. \u2661\nNow I will be the first to note that this Alfredo sauce recipe is \u201cAmerican-style,\u201d a la the Olive Garden version that zillions of us grew up loving.\u00a0 By contrast to its Italian-style origins, in which the sauce was created in Rome with just butter and cheese (more similar to my cacio e pepe recipe ), American-style Alfredo sauce is famously a bit more indulgent and complex.\u00a0 Heavy cream and/or milk are typically added to make the sauce creamier, differing levels of flour are added to create a roux and make the sauce thicker, and a number of different seasonings are often added (especially a hint of white pepper and nutmeg) to give it an extra flavor boost.\u00a0 So while this may come as a surprise to some, the American-style version of this sauce would definitely not be considered authentic in Italy.\u00a0 But hey, I think we can all agree that the creamy version of this sauce has become an iconic favorite of its own. \u2661\nThat said, though, all American-style Alfredo sauce recipes are\u00a0 definitely not created alike!\u00a0 I don\u2019t know about you guys, but I have been served far too many Alfredos over the years that were gloppy and greasy and devoid of good flavor, which simply will not do.\u00a0 (Especially when indulging in a cream sauce\u2026I want it to be amazing!)\u00a0 So today, I\u2019m sharing my favorite homemade Alfredo recipe that I have tweaked over the years to perfection.\nMy version is made with a base of half milk and half cream, so that it\u2019s still rich and creamy but not overly heavy.\u00a0 It\u2019s seasoned with plenty of garlic plus a hint of white pepper and nutmeg, all of which serve to balance out those creamy flavors nicely.\u00a0 It\u2019s just slightly thickened with a tablespoon of flour, which you are also welcome to leave out entirely if you prefer.\u00a0 And best of all, it\u2019s made with lots and lots of freshly-grated Parmesan, which is really the main flavor we all want and love in a good Alfredo.\nOh and bonus?\u00a0 The entire recipe is incredibly easy to make and comes together in just 15 minutes.\u00a0 And, of course, it tastes a million times better than anything that you can buy in a jar.\u00a0 Perfect for tossing with pasta, topping grilled chicken, spreading as a white pizza sauce, mixing into lasagna and baked ziti, or whatever else sounds good.\nI\u2019m telling you, this Alfredo sauce is always a winner.\u00a0 So let\u2019s make some!\nAlfredo Sauce Recipe | 1-Minute Video\nHomemade Alfredo Sauce Ingredients:\nTo make this American-style Alfredo sauce recipe, you will need the following ingredients:\nButter:\u00a0 Or you could also substitute olive oil, if you prefer.\nGarlic:\u00a0 Finely-minced or pressed.\nAll-purpose flour:\u00a0 To help form a roux and thicken the sauce.\u00a0 If you are making gluten-free Alfredo sauce, however, you are welcome to omit the flour and have a slightly thinner sauce.\u00a0 Or you can use a cornstarch slurry to thicken it (see details below).\nHeavy cream and milk:\u00a0 We will use this blend as the base for our sauce.\nParmesan cheese:\u00a0 I recommend freshly-grating your Parmesan cheese so that it will melt more smoothly into the sauce.\u00a0 Also, grated Parmesan cheese can be tricky to measure correctly simply with a measuring cup, so I recommend using a kitchen scale if you own one.\nSea salt and white pepper :\u00a0 I like to use fine sea salt and white pepper to season this sauce.\u00a0 If you are new to cooking with white pepper, please note that it has a slightly different flavor and is significantly more potent than black pepper, so you do not need to use as much.\u00a0 That said, if you only have black pepper in the house, that will work too.\nGround nutmeg : \u00a0A pinch of nutmeg is typically used in American-style Alfredo, but you can omit this if you prefer.\nHow To Make Alfredo Sauce:\nAlright, let\u2019s talk about how to make Alfredo sauce!\u00a0 Simply\u2026\nSaut\u00e9 garlic.\u00a0 Briefly saut\u00e9 the garlic in butter until it is lightly golden (be sure not to overcook it).\u00a0 Then stir in some flour to form a roux.\nAdd the milk and cream.\u00a0\u00a0 And whisk until evenly combined.\nSimmer. Continue cooking the sauce until it reaches a simmer, then reduce heat to maintain the simmer, add in the Parmesan, salt, white pepper and nutmeg, and whisk until the cheese is completely melted and the sauce is smooth.\nSeason. Don\u2019t forget to taste and season with extra salt and/or white pepper, if needed.\nServe.\u00a0\u00a0 And\u2026enjoy!\u00a0 So simple, right?!\nPossible Recipe Variations:\nThere are all sorts of ways that you can customize this basic Alfredo sauce recipe, so feel free to experiment and get creative!\u00a0 Here are a few of my favorite variations\u2026\nMake it gluten-free:\u00a0 To make gluten-free Alfredo sauce, just omit the flour (and have a slightly thinner sauce).\u00a0 Or, you can omit the flour and use a cornstarch slurry (equal parts cold water and cornstarch, added to the sauce as it is simmering) to thicken the sauce.\nMake it lighter: To make a lighter Alfredo sauce, use milk in place of heavy cream (so 2 cups of milk total, no cream).\nMake it extra-garlicky:\u00a0 If you want to make your sauce extra-garlicky, feel free to double the amount of garlic cloves.\nUse roasted garlic: If you want even more complex garlic flavors in the sauce, skip the minced garlic and instead roast an entire head of garlic and stir the cloves into the sauce to make a delicious roasted garlic Alfredo sauce.\nAdd Cajun seasoning:\u00a0 To make Cajun Alfredo sauce, stir your desired amount of Cajun seasoning (I recommend 2 to 4 teaspoons, to taste) into the sauce.\nAdd pesto:\u00a0 If you happen to have some basil pesto on hand, try stirring in a few tablespoons to make a delicious pesto Alfredo sauce.\nWays To Use Alfredo Sauce:\nThere are endless ways that you can put this Alfredo sauce recipe to delicious use!\u00a0 For example, feel free to make\u2026\nAlfredo Pasta: Fettuccine Alfredo is obviously the most famous option here, but any shape of pasta will do.\u00a0 To make traditional fettuccine Alfredo, cook 1 pound of fettuccine until al dente, drain, then toss with the Alfredo sauce until combined.\u00a0 Feel free to add in cooked proteins of your choice (for example, to make chicken Alfredo pasta, shrimp Alfredo, or meatballs Alfredo).\u00a0 And of course, veggies such as broccoli, mushrooms, asparagus and more are delicious additions too!\nHomemade Pasta Option: Or, if you really want to kick your Alfredo pasta up a notch, try making it with homemade pasta! One batch of this sauce will pair perfectly with one batch of my favorite homemade pasta recipe .\nAlfredo Pizza:\u00a0 Use this sauce in place of marinara pizza sauce.\nAlfredo Dip:\u00a0 Use this sauce as a dip for breadsticks, veggie sticks, pretzels and more.\nAlfredo Casserole:\u00a0 I also love using this recipe as a sauce in casseroles , baked ziti and white lasagna.\nMore Italian Sauce Recipes:\nLooking to try some other classic Italian sauces?\u00a0 Here are a few of my faves:\nBasil Pesto\nCacio e Pepe\nMarinara Sauce\nSpicy Arrabbiata Sauce\nAglio e Olio (Garlic and Olive Oil) Sauce\nPrint\nAlfredo Sauce\n\u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u2605\n5 from 2 reviews\nAuthor:\nAli\nPrep Time:\n5 mins\nCook Time:\n10 mins\nTotal Time:\n15 mins\nYield:\nAbout 2.5 cup s 1 x\nPrint\nPin\nDescription\nThis homemade Alfredo sauce recipe is easy to make in just 15 minutes, it\u2019s rich and creamy and full of the best garlicky flavors, and always ultra comforting and delicious.\u00a0 See notes above for possible variations too.\nScale\n1x 2x 3x\nIngredients\n1 tablespoon butter\n4 \u00a0cloves garlic, pressed or finely-minced\n1 tablespoon all-purpose flour\n1 cup heavy cream\n1 cup milk (I used 2% milk)\n1 cup ( 1 1/2 ounce s) freshly-grated Parmesan cheese\n1/2 teaspoon\nfine sea salt\npinch of white pepper\npinch of ground nutmeg (optional)\nInstructions\nSaut\u00e9 garlic.\u00a0 Melt butter in a large saucepan or saut\u00e9 pan over medium-high heat.\u00a0 Add garlic and saut\u00e9 for 1 minute, stirring frequently.\u00a0 Stir in the flour and saut\u00e9 for 1 minute more, stirring frequently.\nAdd the milk and cream.\u00a0 Add in the heavy cream and milk and whisk until evenly combined.\nSimmer.

Half and half can be difficult to find in some countries, so I just went with half cream and half milk. :)\nBeth Wilson \u2014\nApril 8, 2020 @ 11:21 am\nReply\nHi,\nCan we use half and half, in lieu of the heavy cream? Unfortunately, organic (which is my choice) heavy cream, contains nasty fillers or stabilizers. The organic half & half, does not. Thanks! And that looks delicious.\nBeth\nAli \u2014\nApril 8, 2020 @ 12:25 pm\nSure thing, that should work well. Enjoy! :)\nDigna \u2014\nApril 8, 2020 @ 1:12 pm\nReply\nAli, I made Alfredo sauce a couple of weeks ago \u2013 similar recipe that I altered quite a bit. It was loved by my husband and adult grandson, my taste team and best critics. I didn\u2019t have cream so used only 1/2&1/2 but will be trying your version this week. Our nice April weather turned dreary suddenly with rain and even light snow this morning, so it\u2019ll be a perfect dinner tonight. I depend on your recipes to keep my meals varied and different.\nJennifer \u2014\nApril 10, 2020 @ 2:25 am\nReply\nWe loved this sauce!!!\n\u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u2605\nWendy \u2014\nApril 13, 2020 @ 8:02 am\nReply\nAli, I have loved every recipe of yours I\u2019ve made, but this Alfredo recipe stands alone atop the podium (very, very close to your pork carnitas, which was first til now!). I used your sauce as a base for a tossed chicken and spinach penne, and I wanted to dive into a pool of the sauce. So delicious! Thank you for sharing your culinary creativity and talent.\nJulia \u2014\nApril 16, 2020 @ 7:04 pm\nReply\nThis was delicious! I used 2% milk and half &half because that\u2019s what I had. So quick, the sauce was done before the pasta! Will be making this a lot in the future.\n\u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u2605\n\u00ab Previous Post\nNext Post \u00bb\nHey, I\u2019m Ali!\nMy favorite thing in life is time spent around the table.

Please read my disclosure policy .\nThis Chicken Alfredo Baked Ziti recipe is made with a lightened-up alfredo sauce, it\u2019s easy to customize with extra veggies and seasonings, and it is always so comforting and delicious.\nCreamy, cozy, cheesy, carb-y comfort food alert. \u2661\nThis time of year, when everyone seems to be craving warm pasta dinners around the table on chilly winter nights, this chicken alfredo baked ziti recipe always goes viral here on the blog.\u00a0 And this time of year, when I make a batch for myself, I\u2019m always reminded how unbeatable this Italian casserole will always be.\u00a0 I mean, creamy alfredo sauce, savory chicken, hearty pasta, two delicious kinds of melty cheese \u2014 what\u2019s not to love?!\u00a0 There\u2019s a reason why this one will always be a classic.\nThat said, while this recipe already features my lightened-up alfredo sauce recipe, there are all sorts of other ways you can make this comfort food a bit healthier if you\u2019d like.\u00a0 From subbing in whole wheat pasta ( this one \u00a0is my go-to), to adding in your choice of veggies (we\u2019re quite partial to broccoli in our house), to making it all gluten-free if you\u2019d like (easy to do with a few simple tweaks), options to customize this casserole abound.\u00a0 And bonus, it can be ready to serve a big crowd in less than 45 minutes.\nWho\u2019s ready for a helping?\nMy original photo for this recipe from 2014.\nChicken Alfredo Baked Ziti Ingredients:\nTo make this Chicken Alfredo Baked Ziti recipe, you will need:\nPasta:\u00a0 Feel free to use any shape (ziti, penne, fettuccine, etc.) and variety (classic, whole-wheat , gluten-free, etc.) of pasta that you prefer.\nShredded, cooked chicken:\u00a0 I either shred a rotisserie chicken, or use leftovers from this baked chicken breasts recipe.\nShredded mozzarella cheese:\u00a0 Feel free to use part-skim or full-fat.\nAlfredo sauce:\u00a0 We will use my lightened-up alfredo sauce recipe, made simply with olive oil (or butter), garlic, flour, chicken stock, low-fat milk, Parmesan, salt and pepper.\u00a0 Also, this recipe is not naturally very saucy.\u00a0 So if you would like, many of our readers recommend doubling the sauce .\nToppings:\u00a0 Freshly-grated Parmesan is a must, in my book.\u00a0 And feel free to sprinkle on some chopped parsley for extra freshness and flavor.\nAlso, see below for suggestions on other delicious ingredients you can add in to this easy baked ziti.\u00a0 (Here\u2019s lookin\u2019 at you, broccoli and Cajun seasoning. \u2661 )\nHow To Make Chicken Alfredo Baked Ziti:\nAlright, let\u2019s talk about how to make baked ziti!\u00a0 Simply\u2026\nPrepare\u00a0the alfredo sauce.\u00a0\u00a0 To make the alfredo recipe, just saut\u00e9 some garlic in olive oil (or butter).\u00a0 Stir in some flour to thicken, add stock and milk and bring to a simmer.\u00a0 Then stir in the Parmesan, season with salt and pepper, and you\u2019re ready to go!\nCook the pasta (and chicken).\u00a0\u00a0 Meanwhile, do some multi-tasking and cook your pasta according to package instructions in a large pot of generously-salted water.\u00a0 Also, if you are cooking your chicken from scratch (vs. using leftovers or shredding a rotisserie), go ahead and cook it while the pasta and sauce are being prepared.\nLayer everything together.\u00a0 Once your pasta, sauce, and chicken are all ready to go, it\u2019s time to combine everything!\u00a0 In your pasta pot, stir together the pasta, alfredo sauce and chicken until combined.\u00a0 Then spread half of the pasta mixture out evenly in a 9 x 13-inch baking dish.\u00a0 Sprinkle on half of the mozzarella.\u00a0 And repeat with the remaining pasta mixture, and remaining half of the mozzarella.\nBake.\u00a0 Transfer the pan to the oven and bake (uncovered) for 20 minutes, or until the cheese is completely melted and has started to brown a bit on top.\nAdd toppings.\u00a0\u00a0

It\u2019s as easy as my Instant Pot Taco Pasta !\nThe Best Chicken Alfredo Pasta\nYou know that dreamy restaurant-style alfredo pasta you crave on the regular and wish you could make at home? Now you can\u2026with minimal effort and a fraction of the cost! The best part, it\u2019s made in your beloved Instant Pot !\nIf you\u2019re a pressure cooker beginner or a very busy person, you\u2019ll have no problem crushing this dump-and-start chicken pasta recipe to get dinner on the table in 30 minutes. It practically makes itself and produces rich, creamy, delicious results every time!\nHow to Make Chicken Alfredo Pasta in the Instant Pot\nBreak uncooked fettucini noodles in half and scatter them in the instant pot in multiple directions. Think of it like a bird\u2019s nest where noodles aren\u2019t resting parallel to each other, but rather stacked in multiple directions.\nScatter butter pieces over the noodles.\nPour in liquids and press pasta noodles under the surface of the liquid.\nPlace uncooked chicken (breast or thighs) on top of the pasta and sprinkle in seasonings. *Note: you can cut the chicken into pieces before pressure cooking or shred it after cooking\u2026your choice. (I prefer to shred it after). See recipe below for details.\nPressure cook for +5 min on high pressure with a 10 min NPR (natural pressure release).\nOpen the lid, transfer chicken to a plate, confirm 165\u00b0 minimum internal temperature, let it rest a minute, and shred it.\nUse tongs to stir the pasta noodles and liquid together.\nAdd parmesan cheese, stirring until sauce thickens.\nAdd shredded chicken to the pasta, serve, and devour.\n* See full recipe below\nGrab my easy Instant Pot recipes\nAlfredo Pasta Instant Pot Cooking tips\nThings to know before you close the Instant Pot lid\nNo pre-cooking : Calling all non -cooks and Instant Pot newbs\u2026this Instant Pot Chicken Alfredo is a dump-and-start recipe. I got you!\nHow to prevent pasta clumping : When adding the uncooked fettuccini noodles to the Instant Pot, break them in half and scatter them in the pot, avoiding stacking them in bundles. Once you\u2019ve added the liquids, don\u2019t stir, just press the noodles down under the liquid surface.\nDo I use raw or cooked chicken for Chicken Alfredo? This Instant Pot chicken recipe was developed using raw chicken. You could use pre-cooked chicken if you like, but you would add it to the alfredo pasta after the cook cycle has completed to prevent drying out.\nChicken breast or chicken thighs : Your choice! Chicken breast is the leaner cut, so it\u2019s quite popular. But chicken thighs seem to never dry out, even as reheated leftovers. Either cut will rock this Instant Pot chicken recipe, but make sure to use the boneless skinless version of either. It\u2019s more convenient than removing bone and skin and reduces the total fat and cholesterol.\nCut up the raw chicken before or after cooking? You are welcome to cut the uncooked chicken breast or thighs into pieces before pressure cooking. However, I prefer to pressure cook them as whole pieces and shred after cooking. This reduces raw-chicken handling, produces fewer dishes, AND helps prevent drying out. FYI, if you go this route, you\u2019ll want to confirm a minimum internal temperature of 165\u00b0 with a meat thermometer at the end of the pressure cooking cycle.\nAfter you open the lid\nIt\u2019s just not very pretty at first : When you first open the lid after pressure cooking Chicken Alfredo, it does NOT resemble a creamy, finished product. Trust me, it\u2019ll get there. First, test your chicken and pasta to make sure they\u2019re adequately cooked before doing the final step that taking this dish to the delicious ending. Here\u2019s how\u2026\nConfirm 165\u00b0 internal temperature of the chicken : If you choose the cook-whole-shred-later option with the chicken in this recipe, you\u2019ll want to confirm a 165\u00b0 minimum internal temperature of the chicken pieces with a meat thermometer after the cook cycle is complete.\nTest the pasta for doneness : Before adding parmesan cheese, test the texture of the pasta noodles to make sure they\u2019re to your liking. They should be fully cooked at this point, as in, slightly beyond al dente. But, if you\u2019re the super -soft pasta type, no prob! Just\u00a0return the lid, close the valve, and add another +1 minute to the instant pot (this time with quick pressure release).\nBringing it all together : Once you\u2019ve confirmed that the pasta and chicken are adequately cooked, it\u2019s time to stir in the parmesan cheese and the sauce will naturally thicken. If you want it thicker, add more parmesan cheese. If you want it thinner, add more liquid.\nNot all pasta brands are equal : I\u2019ve definitely found that different brands of pasta noodles produce different results. This is why I recommend testing the noodles for doneness before thickening the sauce with cheese and pressure cook another minute if needed.\nGrab my easy Instant Pot recipes\nAlfredo Pasta Storage and Reheat tips\nThe pasta soaks up the sauce : When Chicken Alfredo rests after being cooked, it naturally continues to absorb the moisture of the alfredo sauce and can appear dry. I promise you, it\u2019s not dry. It just needs a splash of cream, chicken broth, or plain water during reheat to revive that glistening creaminess that makes alfredo pasta so irresistible.\nFreezing alfredo pasta : I\u2019ve never tried it (because\u2026no leftovers lol), therefore I can\u2019t recommend it based on experience. You\u2019re welcome to try\u2026lemme know if you do!\nChicken Alfredo Ingredient Substitutions\nUse ANY milk in place of half and half (add more parm cheese to balance the fat).\nUse ANY pasta noodles in place of fettuccine.\nUse shredded chicken , canned chicken, or rotisserie chicken instead of raw chicken breast.

Then scatter BUTTER pieces over the noodles.\n* See note below about scattering noodles to prevent clumping.\nAdd HALF AND HALF and WATER. Don't stir, but DO push the pasta down under the liquid to coat it. Then, make sure it stays under (or very near) the liquid surface.\nLay CHICKEN over the pasta. Sprinkle with SALT and BLACK PEPPER. *See recipe notes below about cooking whole chicken breast or thighs or cutting them first.\nSecure the Instant Pot lid; turn the pressure release valve to the \"Sealing\" position; select \"Manual\" and set the Instant Pot on \"High\" pressure for +5 minutes.\nWhen the cycle completes, allow the Instant Pot to sit for 10 minutes, undisturbed, for a natural pressure release (NPR).\nUse an oven mitt to turn the pressure valve to the \"venting\" position to release any remaining steam. When fully depressurized, press CANCEL on the Instant Pot and open the lid.\nTransfer the chicken to a plate, insert a meat thermometer in the center of the chicken to confirm a minimum internal temperature of 165\u00b0, then allow it to rest for a minute or two. ** See recipe notes below about bringing the chicken up to temperature.\nMeanwhile, stir the pasta and liquid together. Test a few noodles for doneness. If you're happy, go to the next step. ** See recipe notes below about cooking pasta more.\nShred the chicken and add it back to the Instant Pot.\nAdd PARMESAN CHEESE to the pasta, stirring to combine all ingredients. Add more salt and pepper, if needed.\nServing, storage, and reheating instructions\nServe Chicken Alfredo pasta warm garnished with parsley.\nTo store, cool the pasta and refrigerate in an airtight container up to five days.\nTo reheat, add a splash of water, half-and-half, or chicken broth to the pasta before heating it up.\nSERVINGS AND NUTRITION\nYield: 4 cups\nServing size: 1 cup\nNutrition facts are provided as a courtesy and are estimates based on unbranded ingredients acquired from a nutrition database. For accurate calculations, please refer to brand packaging information and consult your nutritionist.\nHow to avoid pasta noodle clumping?\nWhen adding pasta noodles to the cooker, scatter them in multiple directions. Think of it like a bird\u2019s nest where noodles aren\u2019t resting parallel to each other and are touching each other as little as possible.\nDo I cut the chicken (breast or thighs) into pieces\u2026or not?\nYou can pressure cook the chicken without cutting it first, and then shred it after it has cooked. Or you can cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces before pressure cooking. I prefer to leave it intact during cooking, and shred later. This reduces raw-chicken handling, makes fewer dishes, AND helps prevent drying out. Win-win-win!\nIf the chicken didn\u2019t reach 165\u00b0 after the cycle completes\nReturn the chicken piece(s) to the Instant Pot (with the pasta still in it!), close the lid, close the valve seal, and allow the cooker to sit for 5 minutes. Do not program it to cook. You\u2019ll need to depressurize again and remove all steam before opening the lid.\nIf the pasta isn\u2019t soft enough after the cycle completes\nIf you prefer your pasta really soft, close the lid, close the valve seal, and allow the cooker to sit for 5 minutes. Do not program it to cook. You\u2019ll need to depressurize again and remove all steam before opening the lid.\nINGREDIENT SUBSTITUTION IDEAS:\nUse ANY milk in place of half and half (add more parm cheese to balance the fat).\nUse ANY pasta noodles in place of fettuccine.\nUse shredded chicken , canned chicken, or rotisserie chicken instead of raw chicken breast (just add it at the end when you stir in the cheese and allow it to get warm).\nNutrition Facts\nInstant Pot Chicken Alfredo\nAmount Per Serving (1 cup)\nCalories 435\nCalories from Fat 198\n% Daily Value*\nFat 22g 34%\nSaturated Fat 13g 81%\nCholesterol 105mg 35%\nSodium 544mg 24%\nPotassium 268mg 8%\nCarbohydrates 45g 15%\nFiber 2g 8%\nSugar 1g 1%\nProtein 15g 30%\nVitamin A 629IU 13%\nVitamin C 1mg 1%\nCalcium 263mg 26%\nIron 1mg 6%\n* Percent Daily Values are based on a 2000 calorie diet.\nTried this recipe?

Instead, it relies on a slight simmer and a heavy dose of cheese.\nSave Recipe\nLevel:\nEasy\nTotal:\n25 min\nActive:\n25 min\nYield:\n4 servings\nShare This Recipe\nPinterest\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nLevel:\nEasy\nTotal:\n25 min\nActive:\n25 min\nYield:\n4 servings\nIngredients\nKosher salt and freshly ground black pepper\n12 ounces fettuccine\nOlive oil, for tossing\n12 ounces boneless, skinless chicken breast (about 2)\u00a0\n1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter\n2 cups heavy cream\n2 pinches freshly grated nutmeg\n1 1/2 cups freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano\u00a0\nDirections\nBring a large pot of water to a boil, and salt generously. Add the pasta and cook according to package directions until al dente, tender but still slightly firm. Strain, and toss with a splash of oil.\nMeanwhile, slice the chicken into 1/4-inch-thick strips, and lay them on a plate or a sheet of waxed paper. Season with salt and pepper.\nHeat a large skillet over medium heat, and add 2 tablespoons of the butter. When the butter melts, raise the heat to medium-high and add the chicken in 1 layer. Cook, without moving the pieces, until the underside has browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip the pieces, and cook until browned and fully cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer the chicken to a medium bowl.\nReduce the heat to medium, and add the remaining 6 tablespoons butter. Scrape the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon to release any browned bits. When the butter has mostly melted, whisk in the cream and nutmeg and bring to a simmer, then cook for 2 minutes. Lower the heat to keep the sauce just warm.\nWhisk the Parmigiano-Reggiano into the sauce. Add the chicken and cooked pasta, and toss well. Season with salt and pepper. Serve hot in heated bowls.\nCook\u2019s Note\nDon't worry if it seems like there is too much sauce. As soon as everything is tossed together, the sauce will start to cling to the pasta and thicken before your eyes!\nCopyright 2015 Television Food Network, G.P.

Baked Kidney Beans with Alfredo Sauce features tortillas packed with a fabulously peppy stuffing of kidney beans, chunky veggies and sauces, and laced with creamy Alfredo Sauce. Alfredo Sauce seems similar to continental white sauce, but it has a different texture and even flavour because of the inclusion of cheese. The packed tortillas are placed in a bed of Alfredo Sauce, topped with more sauce and cheese, and baked till it all fuses together into one irresistible treat! Enjoy it right off the oven for the best flavour and texture. Baked Kidney Beans with Alfredo Sauce is a satisfying One Dish Meal , but if you wish you can team it up with with a bowl of Cream Of Carrot Soup and Mexican Fried Rice .\nAdd your private note\nBaked Kidney Beans with Alfredo Sauce recipe - How to make Baked Kidney Beans with Alfredo Sauce\nTags\nItalian Main Dish Casseroles and Bakes One Dish Vegetarian Meals One Meal Dinner Baked Savoury Baked Easy Baked\nPreparation Time:\u00a0 10 mins \u00a0 &nbspCooking Time:\u00a0 20 mins \u00a0 &nbspBaking Time:\u00a0 20 minutes\u00a0 \u00a0Baking Temperature:\u00a0 200\u00b0C (400 \u00b0 F)\u00a0 \u00a0Total Time:\u00a0 50 mins \u00a0 \u00a0 Makes 4 servings\nShow me for\nservings\nIngredients\ntortillas For The Kidney Beans Mixture 1 cup soaked and boiled rajma (kidney beans) 1 1/2 tbsp\noil 1/2 cup\nonion cubes 1/2 cup\ncapsicum cubes (green , yellow , red) 1 tbsp\ndried mixed herbs 1 tsp finely chopped green chillies 1/4 cup\ntomato puree 1 tsp\ntabasco sauce\nsalt and to taste For The Alfredo Sauce 1 tbsp\nbutter 1 tbsp\nplain flour (maida) 1 cup\nmilk 1/4 cup\ngrated processed cheese\nsalt and to taste Other Ingredients 1/4 cup\ngrated processed cheese\nMethod\nFor the kidney beans mixture\nFor the kidney beans mixture\nHeat the oil in a broad non-stick pan, add the onions, capsicums, mixed herbs and green chillies, mix well and saut\u00e9 on medium flame for 3 minutes.\nAdd the tomato pur\u00e9e, \u00bd cup water and salt, cover the pan with a lid and cook on a medium flame for 3 minutes, while stirring occasionally.\nAdd the rajma, tabasco sauce, salt and pepper, mix well and cook on a medium flame for 2 minutes ,while stirring occasionally.\nFor the alfredao sauce\nFor the alfredao sauce\nHeat the butter in a broad non-stick pan, add the plain flour and cook on a medium flame for 30 seconds, while stirring occasionally.\nAdd the milk, mix well and cook on a medium flame for 2 minutes, while stirring occasionally.\nAdd the cheese, salt and pepper and mix well.

The dish was named after Alfredo Di Lelio who opened a restaurant in Rome in 1914 and served \u201cfettuccine all\u2019Alfredo. Fettuccine Alfredo is an exaggerated variation of \"pasta al burro\" or pasta with butter--a dish that Italians understand better as something that would be cooked at home for simplicity and comfort. The dish became popularized in the United States and through commercialization the recipe has evolved to include heavy cream and other ingredients.\nContents\n1\nAlfredo Sauce (original version)\n1.1\nIngredients\n1.2\nPreparation\n2\nAlfredo Sauce (American variation)\n2.1\nIngredients\n2.2\nPreparation\n3\nNotes\nAlfredo Sauce (original version) [ edit ]\nServings: 4 (first course)\nIngredients [ edit ]\n8 oz. or 2 sticks of butter, unsalted and softened to room temperature\n1/2 pound Parmigiano Reggiano cheese (aged 24 months), grated\nSalt\n1 pound Fettuccine egg noodles\nPreparation [ edit ]\nwhisk together the butter and grated Parmesan-Reggiano cheese until it is creamy. Both ingredients combined should be on the thick side.\nPut water to boil in a large pot and prepare the noodles until al dente\nDrain the noodles and reserve 1/2 cup of liquid to emulsify your sauce\nPut noodles back in the warm pot and stir in the butter and cheese mixture with vigorous turning motion while adding pasta water until the noodles are glistening and smooth.\nAdd salt to taste\nServe immediately.\nAlfredo Sauce (American variation) [ edit ]\nThis recipe will make enough sauce for one pound of pasta, which, together, could serve 6 as a first course.\nIngredients [ edit ]\n1\u00be cups (400 ml) heavy cream\n6 tbs. unsalted butter\n8.5 ounces (240 grams) grated Parmesan cheese or asiago cheese\n1 tsp. salt\nfresh-ground black pepper\npinch of fresh-ground nutmeg\nPreparation [ edit ]\nCombine 1\u00bc cups (300 ml) cream and the butter in a pan large enough to accommodate the sauce and later the pound of pasta.\nHeat over a low flame, stirring frequently, until the butter is melted and the cream comes to a bare simmer.\nRemove the pan from the heat once the butter is evenly incorporated into the cream.\nCook the pasta, draining it a little before it reaches the al dente stage. The pasta should be slightly undercooked before being added to the sauce because it will continue to cook while the sauce is being finished.\nDrain the pasta.\nAdd the drained pasta, \u00bd cup (100 ml) of cream, the cheese, the salt, the nutmeg, and several grinds of the pepper mill to the pan\nHeat the pasta and sauce over a low flame, tossing continuously, until the cheese melts into the sauce and the sauce thickens slightly, about one to two minutes. You can add chopped parsley as a garnish mixed into the sauce.\nNotes [ edit ]\nAlfredo Di Lelio, for whom the dish is named, was a Roman innkeeper. Between the 1910s and the 1950s he owned a popular restaurant named Alfredo all'Augusteo in Piazza Augusto Imperatore in the center of the city. The restaurant, now called \"Il Vero Alfredo - Alfredo di Roma\", is run by the granddaughter of Alfredo Di Lelio, Ines Di Lelio.\nThe original name of the dish, created in 1914, was Fettuccine al triplo burro (Fettuccine with triple butter).\nFettuccine is the traditional pasta for Alfredo and its variations because the broad noodles provide just the right platform for the butter fat and cheese.\nFresh egg pasta is greatly preferred by some over dried pasta for cream and cheese sauces because the sauce sometimes clings more readily to fresh pasta than it does to dried.\nWikipedia has related information at Alfredo (sauce)\nRetrieved from \" https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Cookbook:Alfredo_Sauce&oldid=3445254 \"\nCategories :\nEasy recipes\nRecipes\nDairy recipes\nRecipes with metric units\nVegetarian recipes\nNavigation menu\nPersonal tools\nNot logged in\nDiscussion for this IP address\nContributions\nCreate account\nLog in\nNamespaces\nRecipe\nDiscussion\nVariants\nViews\nRead\nEdit\nView history\nMore\nSearch\nNavigation\nMain Page\nHelp\nBrowse\nCookbook\nWikijunior\nFeatured books\nRecent changes\nDonations\nRandom book\nUsing Wikibooks\nCommunity\nReading room\nCommunity portal\nBulletin Board\nHelp out!\nPolicies and guidelines\nContact us\nTools\nWhat links here\nRelated changes\nUpload file\nSpecial pages\nPermanent link\nPage information\nWikidata item\nCite this page\nIn other languages\nAdd links\nSister projects\nWikipedia\nWikiversity\nWiktionary\nWikiquote\nWikisource\nWikinews\nWikivoyage\nCommons\nWikidata\nPrint/export\nCreate a collection\nDownload as PDF\nPrintable version\nThis page was last edited on 22 July 2018, at 02:19.\nText is available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License. ; additional terms may apply.

Add the pasta and cook according to package directions until al dente, tender but still slightly firm. Strain, and toss with a splash of oil.\nMeanwhile, slice the chicken into 1/4-inch-thick strips, and lay them on a plate or a sheet of waxed paper. Season with salt and pepper.\nHeat a large skillet over medium heat, and add 2 tablespoons of the butter. When the butter melts, raise the heat to medium-high and add the chicken in 1 layer. Cook, without moving the pieces, until the underside has browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip the pieces, and cook until browned and fully cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer the chicken to a medium bowl.\nReduce the heat to medium, and add the remaining 6 tablespoons butter. Scrape the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon to release any browned bits. When the butter has mostly melted, whisk in the cream and nutmeg and bring to a simmer, then cook for 2 minutes. Lower the heat to keep the sauce just warm.\nWhisk the Parmigiano-Reggiano into the sauce. Add the chicken and cooked pasta, and toss well. Season with salt and pepper. Serve hot in heated bowls.\nCook\u2019s Note\nDon't worry if it seems like there is too much sauce. As soon as everything is tossed together, the sauce will start to cling to the pasta and thicken before your eyes!\nCopyright 2015 Television Food Network, G.P.

Half of the calories and you won\u2019t even be able to tell!\u00a0\nCarbs. Oh man. Carbs are my WEAKNESS. When I am trying to watch what I eat, chocolate and sweets do not tempt me at all. Its the carbs. I dream all day of a big bowl of pasta and carbs sitting right in front of me. Along with a couple of slices of warm bread. I just love my carbs.\nWell stuffing your face with carbs is not the best way of losing weight. And because I count macros, I can only can have 40% in my diet to reach my daily goal. So I decided to take my favorite alfredo sauce and change the ingredients and combine it with whole wheat pasta.\nThis alfredo sauce is the best out there. I changed out some of the ingredients to reduce calories and used low fat milk and reduced fat cream cheese. I was able to cut the calories in half and it was absolutely amazing!\nThis is just one of the recipes that you will want to continue making though out the year. I am such a huge believer in keeping things delicious but swapping out for healthier ingredients to keep your goals throughout the year practical and achievable.\nAnd I still gotta have my carbs. My reward meal each week usually consists of going with the family to the spaghetti factory and loading up on their famous Brown Butter Mazithra Cheese Spaghetti.\nThis is a meal that the entire family is going to love. It comes together easily and is ready to go onto the dinner table in just about 30 minutes!\nWatch a video on how to make Skinny Fettuccini Garlic Alfredo here:\nSkinny Fettuccini Garlic Alfredo\nPrep Time\n15\nminutes\nCook Time\n15\nminutes\nTotal Time\n30\nminutes\nAuthor\nAlyssa Rivers\nServings\n6\nServings\nPrint\nReview\nA lightened up garlic alfredo sauce that is delicious and creamy and coats the pasta perfectly! \u00a0Half of the calories and you won\u2019t even be able to tell!\u00a0\nCourse\nDinner, Main Course\nCuisine\nAmerican, Italian, Italian American\nIngredients\n12\nounce\nwhole wheat fettuchini pasta\nGarlic Alfredo Sauce:\n2\nTablespoons\nButter\n2\ngarlic cloves\nminced\n2\nTablespoons\nflour\n2\ncups\n1% milk\n2\nounces\nReduced Fat Cream Cheese\n1\nteaspoon\ngarlic powder\n1\nteaspoon\nitalian seasoning\n\u00bc\nteaspoon\nsalt\n\u00bc\nteaspoon\npepper\n3/4\ncup\ngrated parmesan cheese\nchopped fresh parsley for garnish\nif desired\nInstructions\nIn a large pot cook the pasta according to package directions.

What brand of WW fettuccini do you suggest?\nReply\nAmber\nsays:\nNovember 5, 2017 at 8:24 pm\nI usually make your original sauce with heavy whipping cream, which is so delicious but too thick and heavy for us. Do you think it\u2019s because I might have it on the heat too long? I\u2019ve even tried to thin it with milk.

This is the best and most simple recipe for Alfredo sauce that you will find!\nThis is one of my absolute favorite sauces to make. Why? Well its incredibly easy , it\u2019s so versatile, and the three main ingredients are butter, cream, and cheese. How can you go wrong with that ?! While I used this sauce over pasta, you can make pizzas and flatbreads with it, or even use it as a dip. Thank you, Italy , for blessing the culinary world once again.\nWhat Is Alfredo Sauce\nNow, some may argue that Alfredo sauce isn\u2019t really Italian- it\u2019s American. I\u2019ll give you a quick history lesson. This sauce was born in Rome from a man named Alfredo. His sauce was a simple emulsification of butter, Parmesan cheese, and pasta. The version we know and love today includes garlic and cream for a saucier consistency. So I guess we can call this modernized sauce an Italian-American lovechild.\nTips for Making the Perfect Alfredo Sauce\nThe sauce will seem thin when you start to mix in the pasta. Don\u2019t worry, just keep tossing. The starches from the pasta will mix into the sauce to give the the perfect consistency. If you use flour or cornstarch to thicken the sauce, it may come out with a gluey consistency once it\u2019s cooled down a bit.\nYou can add a few tsp of Italian seasoning, a pinch of nutmeg or red pepper flakes to add some flare to this sauce. Feel free to get creative with seasoning.\nYou can adjust the ratio of cream to milk in this recipe to suit how rich you\u2019d like it to be.\nIf you try this recipe, please let us know!

Thank you for your many insights. I just wanted to add some insights I\u2019ve learned when we were in Rome at Alredo\u2019s Originale\u201d the way they make it is with butter, and pasta water and parmigiana cheese. I\u2019ve since adapted my recipe to a dash of half & half. I think it cuts down the calories and fat somewhat? But the technique is the same.\nReply\nJoanna Cismaru\nsays\nApril 23, 2020 at 10:07 am\nGreat tips, I\u2019ll have to try it next time. \ud83d\ude42\nReply\nnabilah\nsays\nMarch 11, 2020 at 12:39 am\nAwesome.

We double the recipe and added air fry chicken thighs cut in small pieces. The best Alfredo recipe ever. We side aside a small part with sausage. Let me tell you better than the famous restaurant.

Loved it. So creamy with tons of flavor. I made extra Alfredo sauce since my hubby prefers saucy pastas. Per your suggestions, I added thinly sliced mushrooms and chicken. Cooked the chicken ahead of time, but the mushrooms cooked right in the Alfredo. This will be my go to Alfredo! Comes together quickly.

I think you had one for a cheesy chicken casserole using chicken breasts and ranch dressing with macaroni noodles but I cannot find it on your web site. I am getting old and forgetful, so perhaps I saw it somewhere else. It sounded good and I want to try it so if you can help me that would be great. Cooking keeps me sane!\nReply\nJoanna Cismaru\nsays\nSeptember 12, 2018 at 11:26 pm\nMaybe you saw it on my other blog, Jo Cooks.

This recipe is for a large dinner party. Please feel free to scale the recipe down for a small family. Note: Make sure you whisk in the flour early while you are melting the butter with the garlic to avoid a &quot;floury&quot; flavor. The flour is important to avoid a thin sauce. This sauce is very versatile. Add grilled marinated chicken for a great Chicken Alfredo. Add saut&eacute;ed shrimp and scallops with Old Bay Seasoning, white wine, shrimp stock, and chopped green onions for Seafood Alfredo. Extra sauce can be frozen for later use.\n34\nPeople talking\nJoin In Now\nJoin the conversation!\nREADY IN:\n45mins\nSERVES:\n14\nYIELD:\n1\ngallon\nUNITS:\nUS\nINGREDIENTS\nNutrition\n2\nquarts heavy cream\n1\nlb butter\n2\ntablespoons flour\n1\nlb freshly grated parmesan cheese\n4\nounces Fontina cheese\n3\ntablespoons minced garlic\n1\nteaspoon salt\n2\nteaspoons black pepper\nNUTRITION INFO\nServing Size: 1 (212) g\nServings Per Recipe: 14\nAMT.

Baked Kidney Beans with Alfredo Sauce features tortillas packed with a fabulously peppy stuffing of kidney beans, chunky veggies and sauces, and laced with creamy Alfredo Sauce. Alfredo Sauce seems similar to continental white sauce, but it has a different texture and even flavour because of the inclusion of cheese. The packed tortillas are placed in a bed of Alfredo Sauce, topped with more sauce and cheese, and baked till it all fuses together into one irresistible treat! Enjoy it right off the oven for the best flavour and texture.

A century along in its development, it's hard to know for sure whether its success was more due to spontaneous reactions from the people who first ate it, or inspired marketing by its inventor.\nThe legend (as seen on the web page of the restaurant owned by the inventor's descendants) goes like this: Once upon a time (all right, 1914), Alfredo di Lelio worked in his parents' little restaurant. He married a lovely girl who eventually became pregnant with their first child: and when she did, she lost her appetite completely. Alfredo was worried about his wife, and tried for a long time to come up with something that would tempt her palate.\nFinally Alfredo made up a batch of a light semolina pasta -- lighter than a plain flour pasta -- and dressed it with nothing but butter and a little Parmigiana-Reggiano cheese. (Here the story as presented on the website takes an inadvertently humorous turn: \"When the dish was ready... he brought it to his wife, saying: \"If you don't want it, I will eat it!!!\" Well, why waste?) Anyway, Mrs. Alfredo (no amount of searching has so far turned up her name -- which just seems wrong, somehow: without her, where would Alfredo's descendants be now?) loved the dish, and gobbled it up.\nAlfredo began offering his new pasta dish in the restaurant, where it became a huge hit. And eventually he went on to open his own restaurant, where famous people from all over the world came to eat his wonderful pasta. The movie stars Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford came too, on their honeymoon, and were so impressed by Alfredo's pasta that they gave him a golden fork and spoon engraved with the words, \"The King of Fettucine.\" And Alfredo became famous all over the world, and lived (we must assume) happily ever after. Certainly his grandson (Alfredo the Third) still presides over the restaurant his father started, and wields the Golden Fork and Spoon with his own hands, and licenses his name all over the place, in distant locales like S\u00e3o Paulo, Mexico City, New York, and Disney World.\nIt's a lovely story. As usual with fairy tales, though, the truth gets somewhat buried under the archetypes. A former correspondent for the New York Times visited Alfredo II's restaurant in the 1950's and reports some unsettling things: that the recipe wasn't original with Alfredo, that it was all over the place under the names fettuccine alla Romana or fettucine alla burro , and that the only thing Alfredo had done differently was to triple the butter. Later it turned out that there were now two sets of the Golden Fork and Spoon, each claiming to be the original. One set can be found at Alfredo's old place at 104 via della Scrofa (sold on when he retired, still operating (though to rather mixed reviews) and actively marketing itself) . The other is at his new place at 30 Piazza Augusto Imperatore (which Alfredo opened at the instigation of businessmen who thought he should market the dish more widely, in conjunction with Italy's Holy Year in 1950). Other food writers suggest that hardly anyone in Italy (except restaurateurs with their eye on the tourist trade) would recognize the dish by the name fettuccine Alfredo or pasta Alfredo . Ordinary Italians generally don't even recognize this simple treatment as a \"dish\", but more the kind of thing that a tired mom would plunk down in front of the kids at the end of the day.\nAt any rate, no culinary legend survives contact with the cooking world for long. The recipe unquestionably became famous: and as soon as that happened, people started messing around with it. It is now hard to find any place serving fettuccine all'Alfredo that does it according to Alfredo I's original recipe -- excepting, of course, his own restaurants. Cream and sometimes even egg yolks have snuck into the recipe somewhere along the line, not to mention peculiar additives like cream cheese, cottage cheese, and other ingredients meant to thicken the sauce less expensively than with that fancy cheese and all that butter. In particular, there are now many people who would not recognize the dish or acknowledge it as fettuccine all'Alfredo if the cream wasn't there. (Ask the manager at Alfredo's of Rome in New York: \"You can tell them five times there's no cream. They won't believe you.\" )\nSo we're offering two versions of the recipe: the original (as revealed by the chef of his New York restaurant) and the simplest version containing cream. Our thought, though, is that the original recipe is probably the best -- and if you make it with good enough pasta, cheese and butter, even the Golden Fork and Spoon probably wouldn't make a difference one way or another.\nClick on \"read more\" for the recipes.\nThe original recipe:\n1 lb. of fresh, thin fettuccine\n6 oz. unsalted butter\n6 oz. Parmigiano Reggiano cheese (aged 24 months), grated\nBring the butter to room temperature. Blend it with the grated cheese in a bowl (or in the small bowl of a food processor if you prefer) until the cheese almost vanishes into the butter: usually this takes two or three minutes. The effect should be that of a smooth, thick cream. Cook the fettuccine noodles in lots of salted boiling water for three minutes. Strain the pasta, leaving it just a little wet, and toss the noodles with the sauce. Serve in pasta bowls. Add some more grated Parmigiano if you like.\nThe version of the recipe that contains cream:\nMMMMM----- Recipe via Meal-Master (tm) v7.01 Title: Fettuccine With Butter & Cream - Fettuccine All'alfredo Categories: Italian, Pasta, Main dish Servings: 6 Basic egg pasta dough * 1/4 c Butter 1 c Whipping cream Salt White pepper 1/4 c Fresh grated Parmesan cheese Additional Parmesan cheese Prepare noodles using Basic Egg Pasta Dough (made with 2-1/4 cup all-purpose flour) Melt butter in a large skillet. When butter foams, add cream. Simmer over medium heat about 2 minutes until slightly thickened. Season with salt and white pepper. Fill a very large saucepan two-thirds full with salted water. Bring water to a boil. Add noodles. Bring water back to a boil and cook noodles uncovered until tender, but firm to bite. Drain noodles and place in skillet with cream. Add 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Toss noodles and sauce over medium heat until sauce coats noodles, 20 to 30 seconds. Serve immediately with additional Parmesan cheese. Makes 4 to 6 servings. MMMMM\n\u00a0\nMMMMM----- Recipe via Meal-Master (tm) v8.05 Title: Basic Egg Pasta Dough Categories: Pasta Yield: 8 Servings 4 1/2 c All-purpose flour 6 Eggs Recipe by: Northern Italian Cooking Put flour on a pastry board and make a well in the center. Break the eggs into well; beat with a fork. Draw some flour from inner rim of well over eggs, beating constantly. Keep adding flour a little at a time until you have a soft dough. Put dough aside. With a pastry scraper, remove bits and pieces of dough attached to board. Lightly flour board and your hands. Knead dough 10 to 12 minutes, adding flour a little at a time until dough is smooth and pliable. Insert a finger into center of dough. If it comes out almost dry, dough is ready for pasta machine. If dough is sticky, knead it a little longer adding more flour. Cut an egg-size piece from dough. Wrap remaining dough in a cloth towel to prevent it from drying. Set rollers of pasta machine at their widest setting. Flatten small piece of dough, dust with flour and fold in half. Run it through pasta machine. Repeat this step 5 to 8 times until dough is smooth and not sticky. Change notch of pasta machine to the next setting and run dough through once without folding. Keep changing setting and working pasta sheet through machine until pasta reaches desired thickness. A good thickness for general use is about 1/16 inch. Sprinkle dough with flour between rollings if it is sticky.

Ready and on the table in less than 20 minutes!\nCrispy golden seared chicken is mixed through a super creamy garlic parmesan Alfredo sauce! Our favourite Chicken Alfredo recipe with the pasta cooked right in is perfect comfort food at its finest.\nCHICKEN ALFREDO\nMove over store-bought Alfredo sauces and even restaurant Alfredo. This chicken Alfredo recipe has the best homemade Alfredo sauce! SO MUCH FLAVOUR!\nThis recipe is for those emergency dinner moments \u2014 a\u00a0 throw-it-all-in-a-pot-recipe you can do in minutes! Just a simple pot and humble stove top needed.\nHOW TO MAKE CHICKEN ALFREDO\nSear chicken thighs (or breasts) first to enjoy the crispy golden texture through the creamy pasta, then remove them to ensure a juicy chicken pieces. You\u2019re more than welcome to dice the chicken first, sear, then leave in the pot to continue cooking with the rest of the ingredients on from Step 2 in the recipe box (at the end of this post).\nTIPS FOR ONE POT ALFREDO\nThere are three main steps to this recipe. CHICKEN \u2192 ALFREDO SAUCE \u2192 PASTA.\nThe sauce I use includes wine. I love wine in this but you can leave it out all together if you wish.\nIf using wine, please use a good quality dry white wine. I use a $20 bottle of Pinot Grigio in most of my recipes on this site, but a good Sav Blanc or Chardonnay will suit the favours in this creamy sauce.\nYou can substitute the heavy cream (or thickened cream) with half and half or a reduced fat cooking cream to reduce the calories. You can also use evaporated milk depending on your dietary requirements.\nUsing freshly grated parmesan cheese enhances the flavour and ensures the cheese melts through the sauce. Please don\u2019t use powdered parmesan.\nRemove the pot off of the stove when the pasta is just cooked al dente (firm to the bite). The sauce begins to evaporate quickly into the hot pasta while it\u2019s resting or waiting to be served.\nChicken Alfredo has never been easier!\nALFREDO SAUCE\nThe sauce in this recipe naturally thickens as the starch from the pasta is released into the sauce while cooking. If the sauce is too thick for your liking, add extra cream (or evaporated milk) in 1/4 cup increments until smooth and silky.\n\u2193\u2193\u2193 LIKE SO\u00a0\u2193\u2193\u2193\nMORE PASTA RECIPES\nSkinny One Pot Chicken Bacon Fettuccine Alfredo\nTuscan Chicken Mac And Cheese (One Pot, Stove Top)\nAvocado Alfredo Zoodles With Chicken + Sun Dried Tomatoes \u00a0(LOW CARB)\nCREAMY CHICKEN ALFREDO RECIPE\nOne Pot Creamy Garlic Parmesan Chicken Alfredo\nCreamy Garlic Parmesan Chicken Alfredo is all cooked in ONE POT!

Since my family likes it I tried this recipe. WOW. It was super. I made the recipe as stated, the only exception was I doubled it as we all enjoy leftovers. I also went ahead and addded all the whipping cream at step 4. It cooked up nice with wonderful flavor. I will definitely will be making this again!\nReply\nIrene\nsays\nMarch 18, 2020 at\nCan i use tortellini with cheese in it to make this? Will it make a difference?

I also steamed some broccoli and added to the pot after the cheese and cream\u2026yummy ?\nReply\nTrista\nsays\nFebruary 13, 2019 at\nSeriously bookmarking this forever ..so delicious!\nReply\nKatherine\nsays\nJanuary 29, 2019 at\nI use fat free half and half to lighten it up. Is that the reason my sauce always breaks? It still tastes delicious, but doesn\u2019t look as good. Love your recipes!!\nReply\nDJ Simpson\nsays\nJanuary 7, 2019 at\nThe easiest and flavorful recipe I have ever made. Simple with a punch of flavors I added some broccoli for texture and to put greens in our life .

Tastes great but there is so much extra sauce. Its not thick and is like soup \ud83d\ude41 lol what did i do wrong? Followed recipe exactly and with all your ingrediants.. wait no i didnt\u2026 i didnt have chicken stock i used water and a chicken cube.. shouldnt have made a difference though?? \ud83d\ude41\nReply\nSam\nsays\nMarch 4, 2020 at\ndid you cook the pasta in the sauce? the starch will help thicken the sauce, as well as the sauce naturally reducing as you simmer it. Mine on the other hand was too thick and rich! Maybe we could mix ours together\nReply\nMichel\nsays\nDecember 10, 2018 at\nHi! I wanted to make this for a Christmas party. I need to at least double it. Should I just double all ingredients? I know that\u2019s whats logical, but with some recipes that\u2019s not the case. Also, should I save sauce to add once I get to the party so it isn\u2019t dry? Sorry, I just want it to be yummy for the party.(: thank you\nReply\nKarina\nsays\nDecember 17, 2018 at\nHello Michel!\nThis is a great idea for a party. Yes, with this you will double all the ingredients. It will work out the best. It would be a great idea to take sauce to the party. That will help keep it moist. Thanks for the comment and for following along with me!!\nReply\nRachel\nsays\nNovember 20, 2018 at\nI just made this recipe tonight and it is hands down the best home made Alfredo sauce I\u2019ve ever made! I\u2019ve used a few different recipes in the past and they came out okay, the texture was always off and they were always missing something. I took out the mushrooms as both myself and my boyfriend don\u2019t love them. I was wanting to use up the rest of our spinach and broccoli before they went bad so I saut\u00e9ed the spinach with the onions and garlic and added the cut up broccoli when I added the pasta and it came out cooked perfectly. I used about 1/2 cup light cream and 3/4 cup heavy cream bc I was also wanting to use it up from my fridge before they spoiled. This was seriously delicious, it tasted just like a great Italian restaurants Alfredo sauce and thats what I\u2019ve been looking for all this time! This will definitely be a keeper, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll have look for another Alfredo recipe !\nReply\nAnjel\nsays\nNovember 8, 2018 at\nDo you have any suggestions for warming up this recipe? I like to have the option for leftovers, but the sauce is usually an issue. Recipe looks delish\nReply\nKarina\nsays\nNovember 11, 2018 at\nI would recommend baking it in the oven. You are welcome to leave some sauce out and when preparing it for reheating adding the extra sauce on top so it does not become dry.\nReply\nNicole\nsays\nNovember 5, 2018 at\nJust made this for dinner tonight and would definitely make it again. Great recipe. I did not include the wine and I added sun dried tomatoes. Tasted great.\nReply\nNicole\nsays\nAugust 27, 2018 at\nHello, Im a little nervous to use Pinot Grigio- Ive used it in the past and the sweetness of the wine overpowers the recipe.\nReply\nMarion\nsays\nAugust 25, 2018 at\nGreat recipe! I just made it, and it tastes delicious! Thanks for sharing ???\nReply\nIvory\nsays\nApril 6, 2018 at\nThis looks amazingly delicious. No surprise, because all you post is mouthwatering. Thanks for sharing.\nReply\nCrystal\nsays\nApril 4, 2018 at\nI have made this twice, first time like it says and the second time I changed the chicken to shrimp and the chicken broth to seafood broth. My children told me it was better than olive garden.\nReply\nKarina\nsays\nApril 6, 2018 at\nWOW!! That is great to hear! Thank you so much for letting me know! I am so glad it was so good for all of you! Thanks for following along with me!\nReply\nTerri\nsays\nMarch 19, 2018 at\nCould you freeze this recipe? If so, would you freeze before or after baking it ?\nReply\nKarina\nsays\nMarch 19, 2018 at\nYou are welcome to freeze it but sometimes it does not heat up well the best because the sauces will separate. I would recommend baking it first then freezing though. Hope that helps and it tastes great! Thanks so much for following along with me!\nReply\nSelma\nsays\nMarch 19, 2018 at\nThank you so much for your GREAT recipes! They turn out as you say they will which is a beautiful thing\u2026 so tired of those \u201cI followed this as written and it did not work!\u201d I will make this for dinner tonight! Your Cinnamon Roll recipe was PERFECT! I gave some to my friend as it is her favorite and it was her birthday.

Even the garlic herb butter sauces I just don\u2019t know how to make the new substitutions without losing the flavor. Please Help me\u2026.\nReply\nKarina\nsays\nMarch 14, 2018 at\nHmmm!! That is a tricky one! I am not sure what all to substitute for the both of you. You can still use dairy free items and add seasoning to enhance the sauce. Would that help?!\nReply\nTalia\nsays\nMarch 13, 2018 at\nI just made this for lunch and holy crap it\u2019s good! My kids licked their plates clean. THANK YOU for your tips.

And if you do, should you adjust the amount of broth added later?\nReply\nKarina\nsays\nMarch 14, 2018 at\nYes, you will want to add broth or another sauce to get the juices in. It will be great! I am excited to hear how it turns out!

Mattison\nTaste of Home\nCreamy, cheesy and comforting: This easy Alfredo sauce is everything you want in a pasta sauce.\nEvery product is independently selected by our editors. If you buy something through our links, we may earn an affiliate commission.\nGrowing up, pasta was my family\u2019s go-to option for easy weeknight dinners, but we never really made anything from scratch. I know an easy Alfredo sauce only takes a few minutes to pull together, but we were more of a box of pasta, jar of sauce and a vegetable side dish kind of family.\nThen, when I went to culinary school, I learned that a classic Alfredo sauce is nothing more than butter, cream, garlic and Parmesan cheese.\nYou don\u2019t even need the jar of sauce! This Alfredo sauce recipe is simple and creates a creamy, cheesy and super flavorful sauce that comes together in a flash. It almost takes longer to cook the pasta than the sauce. Don\u2019t believe me? Read on to learn how to make Alfredo sauce that\u2019s restaurant-worthy.\nTips on Selecting Ingredients\nAlfredo sauce only contains a handful of ingredients. Everything counts, but the cheese is really the most important factor to making this sauce shine. It\u2019s really important to opt for the highest-quality cheese you can afford.\nIn addition to Parmesan cheese, we added Romano cheese to our recipe. It has a sharp, slightly tangy flavor that adds a level of depth to the sauce. If you just want to use one cheese for simplicity, go ahead and use Parmigiano Reggiano . It\u2019s made in Italy and has a deep, rich, nutty flavor. The cheese labeled \u201cParmesan\u201d isn\u2019t authentic. It might have a similar flavor, but it\u2019s saltier and more acidic than the real deal.\nNo matter what you cheese choose, try to avoid the pre-grated stuff. It doesn\u2019t melt as well, and it may contain anti-clumping agents like plant cellulose.\nWhen it comes to cream, stick with heavy cream. We know\u2014it\u2019s not super healthy\u2014but using it is the only way to get Alfredo sauce to thicken naturally. If you swap in half-and-half or milk, you\u2019ll need to add flour or cornstarch to get it thick enough to coat the noodles.\nEssential Tools You\u2019ll Need\nvia amazon.com\nMicroplane Premium Zester\nvia amazon.com\nGood Grips Flat Wire Whisk\nvia amazon.com\nAll-Clad Stainless Cookware\nA multi-clad 12-inch stainless steel fry pan\n($130) is our go-to piece of cookware for making pasta sauces. It\u2019s the perfect size for tossing cooked pasta with sauce. If you need, you can also use it to simmer the noodles in the sauce for an extra boost of thickening power. As a bonus, it\u2019s also oven-safe, so you could use it to make baked pasta, too.\nYou\u2019ll also want a flat wire whisk ($8) when making cream sauces. It\u2019s important to stir constantly when adding the cream (and again when adding the cheese) to keep the sauce from breaking. Broken sauce is greasy and unpalatable, but it\u2019s easy to avoid with the right tools.\nWe also recommend using a Microplane\n($14) for grating the cheese. You could use any old box grater, but the Microplane creates super fine shreds of cheese that melt seamlessly into the sauce. It\u2019s not just good for cheese, either; use it to zest citrus fruit, grate chocolate or create ground nutmeg.\nEasy Alfredo Sauce Recipe\nTaste of Home\nIngredients\n4 ounces uncooked fettuccine\n3 tablespoons butter\n1 garlic clove, minced\n1 cup heavy whipping cream\n1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, divided\n1/4 cup grated Romano cheese\n1/8 teaspoon salt\nDash ground black pepper\nDash ground nutmeg\nMinced fresh parsley, optional\nYield : 2 servings\nInstructions\nStep 1: Cook the pasta\nCook the fettuccine in seasoned pasta water according to the directions for al dente. When it\u2019s finished, drain but don\u2019t rinse it. You don\u2019t want to remove the starch that coats the outside of the noodles, which helps the sauce stick to the pasta. If the pasta finishes before the sauce, you can toss it with a little bit of olive oil or butter to keep the noodles from sticking together.\nStep 2: Prepare the sauce\nIn a large saute pan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and cook until it\u2019s fragrant, about 1 minute. Then, slowly add the heavy cream, whisking constantly as you pour until all the cream is incorporated. Bring the mixture up to a gentle simmer and let it cook for 3 to 4 minutes, until it begins to thicken.\nEditor\u2019s Tip : You can use a saucepan to make the sauce, but we like using a 12-inch fry pan instead. It\u2019s large enough to make the sauce and toss the pasta, so you don\u2019t have to dirty any extra dishes.\nStep 3: Add the cheese\nRemove the pan from the heat. Add a handful of the Parmesan and Romano cheese at a time, whisking to incorporate the first handful before adding the next. When all the cheese is added, return the pan to the stovetop. Simmer the sauce gently over low heat for 3 to 4 minutes, until it\u2019s thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.\nEditor\u2019s Tip : Be careful not to boil the sauce at this point. If the heat is too high, the sauce will break and separate.\nStep 4: Season and serve\nSeason the sauce with salt, black pepper and nutmeg. Add the drained fettuccine to the pan and toss it with the sauce. Portion the pasta into individual bowls and top them with the remaining Parmesan cheese and parsley, if using.\nHow to Thicken Alfredo Sauce\nIf you make the recipe with heavy cream, you shouldn\u2019t need to thicken this Alfredo sauce. Heavy cream contains at least 36% butterfat (as compared to milk\u2019s 3.5% and half-and-half\u2019s 12%). When the cream comes to a simmer, the water content evaporates, leaving a deliciously thick sauce behind. The cheese also adds body when it melts, giving you a naturally thick sauce.\nEveryone\u2019s preferences are different, so you may prefer a sauce that\u2019s thicker than the recipe below. You have a few options for\u00a0 thickening sauce without using flour or cornstarch:\nSimmer the pasta in the sauce . The pasta will exude extra starch, adding body to the sauce.\nAdd extra cheese . It will only make the sauce cheesier and more delicious, so go for it!\nAdd an ounce or two of cream cheese . Cream cheese is naturally thick and creamy, and it has the right flavor profile for Alfredo, too.\nTry an egg yolk . Eggs are great for thickening sauces, but they can scramble when exposed to hot temperatures. You\u2019ll need to temper the yolk first by whisking a cup of the hot sauce into a bowl with the yolk. Then, you can add the tempered yolk mixture to the pot.\nHow to Make a Healthy Alfredo Sauce\nFor a lighter version of Alfredo sauce, try making a roux with one tablespoon each butter and flour. After about two minutes, when the mixture is foamy and bubbling, add your liquid of choice to create a white sauce . You can use one cup of regular milk, half-and-half or a mixture of chicken stock and heavy cream.\nFor a gluten-free version, feel free to use 1-1/2 teaspoons of cornstarch instead. Create a slurry by mixing it with a tablespoon or two of water. Then, bring the liquid to a simmer and whisk in the slurry. Continue to simmer until the mixture is thickened.\nTips for Storage\nProperly stored, cooked pasta can last three to five days in the refrigerator. That said, pasta isn\u2019t the ideal candidate for leftovers. The noodles will continue to absorb moisture as it sits in the refrigerator, so it will be simultaneously soggy and dry upon reheating. We\u2019ve had the best luck by storing pasta in an airtight container and reheating it with an extra splash of milk. It\u2019s not as good as the first day, but it won\u2019t be dry!\nAdd a teaspoon or two of milk or water to the leftover pasta and cook it over low heat on the stovetop. You can also use the microwave at 50% power. Take care not to heat the pasta too quickly, or the sauce will separate and become greasy. Check out these other ways to reheat pasta .\nWhat to Make with Alfredo Sauce\nOnce you\u2019ve mastered this easy Alfredo sauce recipe, use it to make any number of delicious pasta dishes. It\u2019s great with chicken and shrimp (especially when they\u2019re seasoned with Cajun seasoning ). You can also add any number of vegetables, like spinach or kale, broccoli, spring peas, asparagus, mushrooms, zucchini and more.\u00a0Check out these recipes that start with Alfredo sauce .\n1 / 20\nTaste of Home\nGarden Vegetable Gnocchi\nWhen we go meatless, we toss gnocchi (my husband's favorite) with veggies and a dab of pesto.

Add the pasta, and boil according to package directions until al dente, tender but still slightly firm. Strain, and toss with a splash of oil.\nMeanwhile, arrange the shrimp in a single layer on a large pie pan or paper plate, and pat them with a paper towel until completely dry. Season with salt and pepper.\nHeat a large skillet over medium heat, and add 2 tablespoons of the butter. When the butter melts, raise the heat to medium-high, and invert the plate of shrimp over the skillet so the shrimp fall into the pan all at once. Cook the shrimp, without moving them, until the underside is pink, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip the shrimp, and cook until fully pink and cooked through, about 2 minutes more. Transfer the shrimp to a bowl.\nReduce the heat to medium, and add the remaining 6 tablespoons butter. Scrape the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon to release any browned bits. When the butter has mostly melted, whisk in the cream and nutmeg and bring to a simmer, then cook for 2 minutes. Lower the heat to keep the sauce warm.\nWhisk the Parmigiano-Reggiano into the sauce. Add the shrimp and cooked pasta, and toss well. Season with salt and pepper. Serve hot in heated bowls.\nCook\u2019s Note\nDon't worry if it seems like there is too much sauce. As soon as everything is tossed together, the sauce will start to cling to the pasta and thicken before your eyes.\nCopyright 2015 Television Food Network, G.P.

Slightly reducing the cream and adding a hefty dose of cheese means you don't have to use flour to thicken the sauce.\nSave Recipe\nLevel:\nEasy\nTotal:\n25 min\nActive:\n25 min\nYield:\n4 servings\nShare This Recipe\nPinterest\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nLevel:\nEasy\nTotal:\n25 min\nActive:\n25 min\nYield:\n4 servings\nIngredients\nKosher salt\n12 ounces fettuccine\nOlive oil, for tossing\n3/4 pound large shrimp (about 16), peeled and deveined, tails removed\nFreshly ground black pepper\n1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter\n2 cups heavy cream\n2 pinches freshly grated nutmeg\n1 1/2 cups freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese\nDirections\nBring a large pot of water to a boil, and salt generously. Add the pasta, and boil according to package directions until al dente, tender but still slightly firm.

Season with salt and pepper.\nHeat a large skillet over medium heat, and add 2 tablespoons of the butter. When the butter melts, raise the heat to medium-high, and invert the plate of shrimp over the skillet so the shrimp fall into the pan all at once. Cook the shrimp, without moving them, until the underside is pink, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip the shrimp, and cook until fully pink and cooked through, about 2 minutes more. Transfer the shrimp to a bowl.\nReduce the heat to medium, and add the remaining 6 tablespoons butter. Scrape the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon to release any browned bits.

It\u2019s absolutely decadent, made with a cashew cream sauce, and the sauce is made easily in your blender!\nWhere do I start? You\u2019re going to absolutely love and want to devour this Vegan Garlic Alfredo Pasta. I\u2019m talking cheesy, creamy, absolutely indulgent in taste kind of pasta dinner. The kind of dinner that totally hits the spot, and makes you want to curl up on a Friday night. Without the heavy feeling, of course. All my pasta cravings are hereby conquered.\nFirst things first \u2013 I haven\u2019t been a big pasta fanatic. LET me be clear. When a pasta dish is done well \u2013 I am all for that. If you\u2019re a vegetarian or a vegan though, you know that\u00a0 lots of pasta dishes just are\u00a0 not done correctly. Kind of a leftover, oh yeah whoops, kind of scenario, and it can drive you to never want to have pasta again.\nWHAT a terrible nightmarish scenario. Fortunately, after making this Vegan Garlic Alfredo Pasta, I now know I have the best pasta dish sitting and waiting at home on me! You\u2019re going to want to grab some cashews right now so that you can make this for dinner, friends.\nLet\u2019s talk key ingredients. That roasted garlic is a\u00a0 must . I mean, it deepens the flavour of the entire sauce, and really brings it to another level. You\u2019re going to have to wait for your cashews to soak anyway, so you might as well make it. I guarantee it\u2019ll change all of your dishes.\nSpeaking of which, cashews. OMG. Adding soaked cashews to this sauce makes it so creamy and gives it that traditional white colour. No, the sauce won\u2019t taste like cashews, thanks to the addition of another ingredient: lemon or lime juice. This acid helps to neutralise the cashew flavour so all you taste is the cheesiness.\nThe nutritional yeast and the vegan parmesan cheese! I speak all about nutritional yeast here , and I made a vegan parmesan cheese for you here. You can also buy your vegan parm though, so it\u2019s totally up to you. That extra bit of tanginess really ups the sauce, and you can add eons of it on top too. The nutritional yeast in the Alfredo sauce gives it that cheesy flavour, that will have you taste testing the heck out of this sauce.\nAlmond milk and pasta water! Don\u2019t use regular water! Pasta water already has some saltiness, some starch, and is a perfectly seasoned form of water in this sauce. The almond milk of course adds more creaminess.\nBasically what I\u2019m saying is, friends, every ingredient is key here. Including the cooked down onions (adding a nice flavour + umami). What you get is a beautiful vegan Alfredo sauce recipe made in your blender that you can pour back on your pasta and then dig in. The kind of sauce you\u2019ll probably want to put on anything, but will definitely slather all over your pasta.\nThat\u2019s it! Your pasta dreams have come true! Dive in friends, and enjoy!\n\u00a0\nVegan Garlic Alfredo Pasta\nby: Jessica in the Kitchen\nPrep Time 1\nminute\nCook Time 15\nminutes\nTotal Time 16\nminutes\nCourse Dinner, Lunch\nKeyword Dairy Free, Egg Free, Nut Free, Soy Free, vegan, Vegetarian\nPrint\nShare\nFacebook\nTwitter\nGoogle+\nPinterest\nYummly\nTumblr\nEmail\n5 from 3 votes\nIngredients\nPasta\n12\nounces\nany pasta\nI used fettuccine\nchopped parsley\nfor garnish\nVegan Alfredo Sauce\n2\nteaspoons\nvegan butter or olive oil\n1/2\nred onion\nchopped\n1\ncup\ncashews\nsoaked overnight, or in hot water for one hour\n1/4\ncup\npasta water\n1 \u00bd\ncups\nunsweetened almond milk\n4\ncloves\nroasted garlic*\n2\ntablespoons\nnutritional yeast\n\u00bd\nteaspoon\nsea salt\n2\ntablespoons\nvegan parmesan cheese + extra for topping\n1\ntablespoon\nlime juice\nInstructions\nInstructions\nCook pasta according to package directions in a well salted pot of water. Reserve \u00bc cup of the pasta water.\nWhile the pasta is boiling/you're waiting for the water to boil, in a pan over medium high heat, heat the vegan butter or olive oil. Add the onion, stir and let cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.\nRemove the onions from the pan and add it to a blender. Add the rinsed off soaked cashews (without the water), the pasta water, the almond milk, the roasted garlic, the nutritional yeast, the sea salt the vegan parmesan cheese and the lime juice. Blend it all together until completely creamy. If you have a high powered blender this will happen quickly, about 1 minute, if not, just keep blending until completely smooth and creamy. Taste and add more salt or vegan parmesan cheese if necessary.\nWhen the pasta is finished boiling, drain and pour back into the pan you had used earlier or even into a Tupperware container if you want. Pour the Alfredo sauce over and stir to combine completely.\nWhen serving, top with parsley to garnish and more vegan parmesan cheese. Enjoy!\nVideo\nNOTES\n*YES roasted garlic takes about 40 minutes, but you\u2019ll need to wait for your cashews to soak for an hour at least anyway! Cut a bit of the tops off of a whole head of garlic, put it in foil, drizzle olive oil on it, wrap the foil around it and cook it at 450 degrees F for 45 minutes in your oven until the cloves are soft and velvety! Allow it to cool, then push the cloves out.\n\u00a0\nYou can reheat this! Just reheat it in a stove top over medium high heat with a bit more almond milk to thin it out again until hot.\nPrep time doesn\u2019t include soaking the cashews overnight.\nby Jessica\n_-jbxMmYlqE\nShare This Post\nPost navigation\n\u2039\u2039 Older Posts\nNewer Posts \u203a\u203a\nYou Might Also Like\n10 Favourite Vegan Pumpkin Recipes to Celebrate Fall\nRead More\nVegan Arancini \u2013 Fried Rice Balls (Air Fryer Option!)\nRead More\nBanana Berry Beet Smoothie Bowl\nRead More\nleave a comment Cancel reply\nRecipe Rating\n40 comments\nComment navigation\nNewer Comments\nAlbert Bevia\nsays:\nI have always loved alfredo sauce but haven\u00b4t had it in a long time..it makes me feel to heavy and bloated, this vegan version sound like my answer to enjoying this sauce again, and so true, the roasted garlic does give a huge flavor\u2026thanks for the creative recipe \ud83d\ude42\nApril 4, 2018\nReply\nGavin | Jessica in the Kitchen\nsays:\nThanks so much Albert!

Sooo I made this receipe last night and the Alfredo sauce came out liquidity. Your recipe calls for 1 1/2 cup of almond milk? I think I should\u2019ve used about a cup. Any suggestions? Anywho, I\u2019m going to make it again and I won\u2019t use so much milk this time around. Thanks for sharing this recipe!\nApril 6, 2018\nReply\nJessica\nsays:\nHi Cynthia!\nI hope I can help you out! ? What do you mean by came out liquidity/liquidy? If you look in one of the photos you can see that it definitely is pourable and creamy like most homemade Alfredo sauces, but not thin at all, but once it clings to the warm noodles will thicken up almost immediately once coated around. Did that happen to for you? Either way if you want it much thicker you can definitely use less milk! I hope that helps!!

I made it today and it is wonderful. It actually reminded me of the cheese sauce I used to make to go with pasta in my pre vegan days.

I needed an alfredo sauce that didn\u2019t require cauliflower \u2013 and this fit the bill. I saved time by not roasting the garlic (I just sauteed it with the onion). I didn\u2019t have any vegan parmesan so I replaced it with the block cheese made by Daiya Jalapeno/Havarti flavor and OMG this recipe was sooooo good. It was creamy and cheesy! Thank you!\nAugust 8, 2018\nReply\nCourtney\nsays:\nI really want to try this recipe out! But where I live I cannot find the nutritional yeast or vegan parmesan cheese anywhere. What could I use as a substitute for them?\nSeptember 27, 2018\nReply\nJessica\nsays:\nHi Courtney,\nWhere do you live? Maybe I could help based on that since there isn\u2019t a readily easy substitute for the nutritional yeast. Can you order it online? You could make the vegan parmesan cheese using this recipe: https://jessicainthekitchen.com/how-to-make-vegan-parmesan-cheese/\nSeptember 27, 2018\nReply\nKara\nsays:\nI made this for my mum and I for dinner last night. She\u2019s not vegan, and was incredibly skeptical about trying this, but she actually liked it! I liked it too. It was very creamy and delicious. I will absolutely be making this again in the future. I suggest adding more salt and some pepper for a bit more flavour, though.\nOctober 17, 2018\nReply\nAngela\nsays:\nI\u2019ve actually made this twice. Both times it was scrumptious. Thanks for the recipe. It\u2019s the best vegan Alfredo I\u2019ve had. I think the red onion is what sets it apart.\nAnd in case anyone is curious, it worked fine with home-made oat milk instead of almond milk.\nOctober 27, 2018\nReply\nComment navigation\nNewer Comments\nin the kitchen everyday\nNew on the blog is this Hummus Pasta\ud83c\udf5d!

I cook this in the microwave, but I'm sure you could do it on the stove too. Times are what work in my microwave. Please use your own good judgment on times to use in your microwave. (In my quest to eat healthier, I now make it with light butter, light cream and reduced fat Parmesan cheese. It still tastes wonderful, but there isn't any guilt!) PLEASE NOTE! This is an &quot;authentic&quot; Alfredo sauce recipe! Real Alfredo sauce *only* contains butter, cream, Parmesan cheese and pepper. It will be thin and there is no garlic in it! If you want a thicker sauce or one with garlic like modern restaurants serve, please look elsewhere!

You\u2019ll be blown away how good this One Pot Alfredo Pasta is \u2013 the pasta is evenly cooked, the sauce is silky and creamy, not gluggy and thick. This is a game changer!!\nI\u2019m going to be honest with you, I\u2019ve had some bad experiences with one pot pastas.\u00a0When the one-pot pasta phenomenon started, thanks to Martha Stewart (though many Italians have since pointed out that they\u2019ve been doing it for\u00a0 years , it is just that Martha Stewart\u00a0made it popular and more widely known!), I was really cynical. Orzo, yes, it works great cooked in one pot with the sauce. Even macaroni and other short pasta.\u00a0But long pasta?\u00a0Then I tried Martha\u2019s original recipe and was lulled into a false sense of confidence and jumped right on board the one-pot pasta train.\nONE POT ALFREDO PASTA\nLike \u00a0this recipe? Pin it to your DINNER pinboard!\nFollow Real Housemoms on Pinterest\nBut then, disaster struck. Enticed by pretty photos, I tried a one pot creamy spaghetti. It was, to be frank (and I will never ever tell where I got the recipe from), bordering on inedible. And I like to think I have a cast iron stomach.\u00a0The pasta was unevenly cooked, the sauce was hideously gluggy, almost gluey.\u00a0It was an absolute disaster. One of the worst\u00a0things to come out of my kitchen in years.\nMost people would walk away and put it down to a bad recipe. Me? I was fuelled with a challenge. I was determined to come up with a way to make a creamy pasta in one pot.\u00a0It took a few goes but actually wasn\u2019t as hard as I expected. My thinking was that it\u2019s fat in the cream + the starch in the pasta that thickens the sauce. So all I do is add the cream right at the end. If you add it at the beginning, that\u2019s when you end up with gluggy sauce.\u00a0Less than 15 minutes.\u00a0A creamy Alfredo pasta with a luscious silky sauce.\u00a0YES, it\u2019s possible. And it is so, SO good.\nWant more easy pasta recipes?\nPizza Pasta Bake\nOne-Pot Spinach and Artichoke Pasta\nTaco Mac N Cheese Pasta Bake\nOne Pan Chicken Stroganoff\nCreamy Greek Shrimp Pasta\nPasta Carbonara\nMore dinner recipes\u2026\nTool used to make this One Pot Alfredo Pasta recipe\nLarge Skillet :\u00a0This skillet is my go-to kitchen tool.

Add milk, chicken broth, butter, and garlic. Bring to simmer then add pasta.\nMove pasta around every 30 seconds or so until it is softened (around 3 minutes) so it doesn't stick. Once the pasta is softened, reduce heat to medium and stir every couple of minutes.\nAfter another 6 minutes or so, the pasta should be almost cooked but there should still be liquid covering the base of the skillet. Add cream and parmesan and mix.\nSimmer, stirring occasionally, for ~2 minutes, until sauce is thickened and pasta is cooked. If you cook it too long and the sauce goes gluggy, add a splash of hot tap water, it will go back to silky with a few tosses.\nAdjust salt and pepper to taste and serve immediately, garnished with freshly grated parmesan and parsley!\nVideo\nNutrition\nCalories: 743 kcal | Carbohydrates: 64 g | Protein: 26 g | Fat: 42 g | Saturated Fat: 24 g | Cholesterol: 186 mg | Sodium: 1014 mg | Potassium: 554 mg | Fiber: 2 g | Sugar: 9 g | Vitamin A: 1465 IU | Vitamin C: 8.5 mg | Calcium: 524 mg | Iron: 1.9 mg\nTried this recipe?

Who, me? Noooo, never. Okay, maybe. As the countdown to my move out of state begins and everything seems to be going haywire, I find myself needing a little comfort food. My usual go-to comfort food is pasta with butter, Parmesan, and salt and pepper, but today I decided to go a little further and make this creamy yet lightER Spinach Alfredo Pasta.\nGoes well with:\nHomemade Garlic Bread\nLighter Spinach Alfredo Pasta\nWhat is in Alfredo Sauce?\nSo, to be honest, this is not really an alfredo sauce (I actually wanted to call it \u201cfaux-fredo), but sometimes recipes names are a bit figurative. Real alfredo has like, a stick of butter, a pile of Parmesan, and sometimes (especially if you\u2019re in America) a whoooole lot of heavy cream.\nI swapped the heavy cream for whole milk, reduced the butter by a lot , and used a little cream cheese to help thicken and stabilize the sauce. So, it\u2019s no longer technically an alfredo, but hey, it\u2019s close enough for me to pretend and feel like I\u2019m eating something super indulgent.\nDoes Spinach Alfredo Pasta Reheat Well?\nThis Lighter Spinach Alfredo Pasta is definitely better when fresh (although I would NEVER turn down leftovers of this), so if you\u2019re cooking for one or two consider cutting the recipe in half. Luckily, this one is super easy to scale up or down. Just change the number of servings in the \u201cservings\u201d box on the recipe card below and the ingredients will auto-adjust.\n\u00a0\nPrint Recipe\n4.48 from 21 votes\nLighter Spinach Alfredo Pasta\nCreamy and rich, yet never heavy, this Lighter Spinach Alfredo Pasta is an easy and satisfying comfort food.\u00a0\nTotal Cost: $5.92 recipe / $1.48 serving\nPrep Time: 5\nmins\nCook Time: 20\nmins\nTotal Time: 25\nmins\nServings: 4\nIngredients\n12\noz\npenne pasta\n($0.74)\n2\nTbsp\nbutter\n($0.27)\n2\ncloves\ngarlic, minced\n($0.16)\n2\ncups\nwhole milk\n($0.62)\n6\noz.\ncream cheese\n($1.50)\n3/4\ncup\ngrated Parmesan\n($1.23)\n1/4\ntsp\nsalt\n($0.02)\nFreshly cracked pepper\n($0.05)\n4\ncups\nbaby spinach\n($1.33)\nUS Customary - Metric\nInstructions\nBring a large pot of water to a boil to cook the pasta. Once boiling, add the pasta and cook until al dente. Drain the pasta in a colander.\nWhile the pasta is cooking, prepare the sauce. Add the butter and minced garlic to a deep skillet or pot and saut\u00e9 over medium heat for 1-2 minutes, or just until the garlic is soft and fragrant, but not brown.\nTurn the heat down to medium-low. Add the milk to the skillet along with the cream cheese (cut into chunks). Heat the milk and cream cheese while whisking, until the cream cheese has fully melted into the milk.\nWhisk in the grated Parmesan cheese and continue to whisk as the sauce comes up to a gentle simmer. When it reaches a simmer, the sauce will thicken. Turn the heat down to low to keep the sauce warm. Season the sauce with 1/4 tsp salt and a generous amount of freshly cracked pepper.\nAdd the fresh spinach to the sauce and stir it in until it has wilted and become limp.\nFinally, add the cooked and drained pasta to the spinach alfredo sauce and stir to combine. Serve immediately.\nNutrition\nServing: 1 Serving \u30fb Calories: 663.73 kcal \u30fb Carbohydrates: 80.1 g \u30fb Protein: 24.43 g \u30fb Fat: 20.65 g \u30fb Sodium: 821.43 mg \u30fb Fiber: 3.4 g\nNutritional values are estimates only.

While the pasta is cooking, start the \u201calfredo\u201d sauce. Mince two cloves of garlic and add them to a deep skillet or pot with 2 Tbsp butter. Saut\u00e9 over medium heat for 1-2 minutes, or just until the garlic is soft and fragrant, but not brown.\nAdd 2 cups of whole milk to the skillet and turn the heat down to medium-low.\nAlso add 6 oz. cream cheese, cut into chunks. Heat and stir or whisk the milk and cheese until it is fully heated through and the cheese has melted into the milk. You\u2019ll want to use a whisk once the cheese begins to melt.\nWhisk 3/4 cup grated Parmesan into the milk sauce. Continue to whisk while the mixture heats, allowing it to come up to a gentle simmer. When it reaches a simmer, the sauce will thicken. Once the Parmesan has fully melted in and the sauce has thickened, turn the heat down to low to keep the sauce warm. Season the sauce with 1/4 tsp salt and a generous amount of freshly cracked pepper.\nNow it\u2019s time to add the spinach. I buy these huge bags of fresh spinach, which are the same amount as those large tubs you can buy, but it\u2019s only $3.99 (the large tubs are usually more like $5.99). Anyway, add about 4 cups of spinach to the hot alfredo sauce\u2026\nAnd stir it in until it has wilted and limp. This should only take a few minutes.\nFinally, add the cooked and drained penne pasta and stir until everything is combined and coated in the thick sauce.\nAnd that\u2019s it! Now you\u2019re ready to get your pasta on.\nSeriously though, this Lighter Spinach Alfredo Pasta is rich and creamy without being like, \u201cOMG I just ate a brick.\u201d\u00a0\nI\u2019m all about that cracked pepper. \ud83e\udd24\nRelated Posts\nCreamy Pesto Mac with Spinach\nOne Pot Creamy Sun Dried Tomato Pasta\nCreamy Tomato and Spinach Pasta\nBacon and Spinach Pasta with Parmesan\nposted on July 26, 2017 in Egg Free , Main Dish , Pasta Recipes , Quick , Recipe Archives , Sauce , Soy Free\n58 Comments \u00bb\n58 comments on \u201cLighter Spinach Alfredo Pasta\u201d\n\u00ab Older Comments\nLouise \u2014\n04.11.20 @ 4:05 pm\nReply\nI loved it\nMichele \u2014\n02.23.20 @ 6:26 pm\nReply\nYummy!

It was super easy to make too. I know it\u2019s annoying when someone says \u201cit was great\u2026I just changed this, this, and that\u201d. In this case it was 100% fine just as it is written. However, I was trying to clean out the fridge and pantry without shopping, so I ended up using rotini pasta in lieu of penne since it was what I had, and added ground turkey just to add a bit of protein for my growing boy. He scarfed it down and asked for more! I\u2019d call that a win! I\u2019m definitely adding this to my dinner recipe rotation.\u00a0\nEmily \u2014\n09.21.19 @ 2:28 pm\nReply\nThe sauce was thinner than I would have liked too. I added cornstarch and extra parm. The flavor was good though.

That being said, some people might not mind the difference, so I can\u2019t say for sure whether you\u2019d like it or not.\nDarlene Chivinsky \u2014\n09.17.18 @ 7:02 pm\nReply\nI made this for the first time and it was fabulous. I used evaporated milk instead of regular milk ( I remember using it in your one skillet Mac and Cheese recipe also yummy). This made it extra thick and creamy and how I like it. It was absolutely what I was craving and I was able to use ingredients I already had and needed to use up. Why I love this website so much.\nAlicia \u2014\n08.31.18 @ 8:04 pm\nReply\nDelicious. \u00a0For a protein I added some chopped fried chicken tenders.\u00a0\nMichael \u2014\n07.15.18 @ 10:26 pm\nReply\nThis was a supremely delicious recipe. Amazing.\nCristina \u2014\n06.12.18 @ 12:01 pm\nReply\nTurned out pretty well! Sauce was not as thick as I wished, but did thicken the longer it sat.\nAnya \u2014\n05.11.18 @ 1:20 pm\nReply\nI thought this was pretty yummy! I ran into the same problem as some other commenters about the sauce not being thick enough, even though I used whole milk. But then, I came back to the website, and noticed I used 3/4 of shredded parm, not grated! So last minute, I dunked a whole bunch of parm in a can in there, plus 1 tbsp cornstarch mixed with 1 tbsp water. Sauce is the right consistency and pretty yummy. Thank you for the recipe!\nLaura \u2014\n03.22.18 @ 4:31 pm\nReply\nCan I replace milk with heavy whip cream?\nBeth M \u2014\n03.23.18 @ 9:47 am\nReply\nI think that would change the outcome quite a bit. You\u2019d probably need to make other adjustments in the recipe as well, but it\u2019s hard to guess without testing the substitution.\nEric Murphy \u2014\n01.16.20 @ 11:16 pm\nReply\nI made this recipe its amazing I used half and half insted of milk and it came out like a mac and cheese but it was easy to follow and super fast to cook i put veggie pasta to make more healthy\n\u00ab Older Comments\nLeave a Reply Cancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.

I used 2% milk and half &#038;half because that\u2019s what I had. So quick, the sauce was done before the pasta! Will be making this a lot in the future.\nBy: Wendy Ali, I have loved every recipe of yours I\u2019ve made, but this Alfredo recipe stands alone atop the podium (very, very close to your pork carnitas, which was first til now!). I used your sauce as a base for a tossed chicken and spinach penne, and I wanted to dive into a pool of the sauce. So delicious! Thank you for sharing your culinary creativity and talent.\nBy: Jennifer We loved this sauce!!!\nBy: Digna Ali, I made Alfredo sauce a couple of weeks ago - similar recipe that I altered quite a bit. It was loved by my husband and adult grandson, my taste team and best critics. I didn&#039;t have cream so used only 1/2&#038;1/2 but will be trying your version this week. Our nice April weather turned dreary suddenly with rain and even light snow this morning, so it&#039;ll be a perfect dinner tonight. I depend on your recipes to keep my meals varied and different.\nBy: Ali That works too! Half and half can be difficult to find in some countries, so I just went with half cream and half milk. :)\nBy: Ali Sure thing, that should work well. Enjoy! :)\nBy: Beth Wilson Hi, Can we use half and half, in lieu of the heavy cream? Unfortunately, organic (which is my choice) heavy cream, contains nasty fillers or stabilizers. The organic half &#038; half, does not. Thanks! And that looks delicious. Beth\nBy: Kathy Why not use half and half instead of cream and milk?\nBy: Kate I haven&#039;t made this yet, but it looks great to try!!! Could&#039;ve used this last week but will be making the same dish again - alfredo + squash (or pumpkin or sweet potato). Also, was just perusing old recipes for ideas of ways to use my pantry items and saw that you used to do Mailbox Mondays where you answered questions from readers. Can this come back please?!\n"], "_version_": 1665275986393956353, "score": 8.59947}, {"tstamp": ["2020-04-28T09:58:45.126Z"], "digest": ["925447a1f278d1b21b4bdb5fac928d3b"], "host": ["en.wikibooks.org"], "boost": [0.3873124], "id": "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Chicken_Alfredo_Pizza", "title": ["Cookbook:Chicken Alfredo Pizza - Wikibooks, open books for an open world"], "url": ["https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Chicken_Alfredo_Pizza"], "content": ["Cookbook:Chicken Alfredo Pizza - Wikibooks, open books for an open world\nCookbook:Chicken Alfredo Pizza\nFrom Wikibooks, open books for an open world\nJump to navigation\nJump to search\nCookbook | Ingredients | Recipes\n| Pizza\nChicken Alfredo pizza is a recipe for a medium sized pizza, feeding around four people.\nIngredients [ edit ]\n2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts\n(more if you like lots of chicken)\none large jar of Alfredo sauce\none or large package of shredded cheese (e.g. cheddar , mozzarella )\npizza crust - e.g. Basic Pizza Crust (or you can buy the packaged mix for convenience)\none package of pepperoni\n(it gives it that pizza look)\nYou can add whatever you like if you find this recipe a bit bland.\nPreparation [ edit ]\nFirst you need to cut up the chicken and cook it.

We\u2019ve got loads of flavour packed into this simple, hearty dish.\nFrom the number of pasta bakes and\u00a0 other pasta recipes on our site, I think you can guess how much we love pasta.\nI often make tomato-based pasta dishes, but today I felt like sharing a rich and creamy pasta bake . This one is definitely rich! Pasta smothered in a creamy sauce with a little garlic and a hint of white wine (optional) with parmesan, cheddar AND mozzarella! Not forgetting the shredded chicken (a great way to use up leftover chicken) and lots of lovely mushrooms.\nJust talking about it makes me want to eat it all over again.\nSo what exactly is alfredo sauce?\nIt\u2019s a very simple white sauce, usually made with butter , cream and parmesan . It\u2019s most commonly seen with the Italian classic Fettucine alfredo.\nI\u2019m going with a similar flavour profile here, but with some added extras (such as garlic and more cheese!) to make it even more delicious.\nWhat do we need to make this bake?\nThis recipe uses leftover cooked chicken from your Roast Chicken Dinner.\nMore recipes using cooked leftover chicken:\nTuscan Chicken Soup\nCreamy Chicken and Potato Bake\nRoast Chicken & Creamy Garlic Mushroom Burger\nChicken ala King\nGarlic Chicken Pasta with Kale\nHere are the simple steps:\nFull ingredient quantities and instructions are in the recipe card below.\nSoften a chopped onion in a large frying pan with a little oil.

Sprinkle the remaining parmesan and the cheddar and mozzarella on top, then place in the oven for 20-25 minutes until the cheese is golden brown.\nRemove from the oven and sprinkle with parsley before serving.\nRecipe Video\nRecipe Notes\nWhat type of pasta to use:\nI use Fusilli for this, but you can use any larger-sized pasta you like - such as Spiralli (pasta spirals), Penne (tubes cut on the diagonal), Rigatoni (ribbed pasta tubes, square-cut on the ends) and Farfalle (pasta bows) all work particularly well, with no change in amounts or cooking times. You can also use Ziti - which is similar to Rigatoni, but a little smaller and not ribbed (unless you buy Ziti Rigati - which is ribbed). I was thinking of making this dish a baked alfredo ziti, but ziti pasta is very difficult to find in the UK.\nCan I make it ahead?\nYes! You can make ahead up to the point where you have sprinkled the cheese on, then cool, cover with foil and refrigerate for up to a day. Take out of the fridge for an hour before cooking it, to take the chill off the dish (otherwise you mind find you get a cold spot in the middle when baking it). Keep the foil on and heat in the oven at 190C/375F for about 10 minutes, then remove the foil and continue to heat for a further 15 minutes, until hot throughout. Note: the dish will be a little less saucy if you make it ahead, as the pasta will absorb more of the liquid. You can a few tablespoons of stock or hot water before heating the pasta to ensure it\u2019s still saucy if you like.\nWill it freeze?\nYes, once cooked: Cool quickly, cover and freeze. Defrost in the refrigerator overnight, then take out of the fridge for an hour before cooking it. Reheat in the oven (covered in foil) at 190C/375F for about 20-25 minutes until hot throughout. Add a few tablespoons of stock or hot water when reheating the pasta to ensure it\u2019s still saucy.\nNutritional information is per serving (this recipe contains 6 servings)\nNutritional Information\nNutrition Facts\nCreamy Chicken Alfredo Pasta Bake\nAmount Per Serving\nCalories 666\nCalories from Fat 288\n% Daily Value*\nFat 32g 49%\nSaturated Fat 17g 85%\nCholesterol 122mg 41%\nSodium 779mg 32%\nPotassium 531mg 15%\nCarbohydrates 56g 19%\nFiber 3g 12%\nSugar 4g 4%\nProtein 35g 70%\nVitamin A 908IU 18%\nVitamin C 2mg 2%\nCalcium 360mg 36%\nIron 2mg 11%\n* Percent Daily Values are based on a 2000 calorie diet.\nTried this recipe?

Put the cauliflower, broth, and 1 cup water in a small pot; bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Adjust the heat to maintain a simmer and cook until the cauliflower is very soft, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool 5 minutes. Carefully puree cauliflower and all the liquid in a blender until very smooth; set aside.\n2. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta until al dente, 8 minutes. Drain well, reserving about 1 cup pasta cooking water.\n3. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the cauliflower puree and evaporated milk and bring to a simmer. Cook until slightly thickened, 5 minutes and season with salt and pepper. Stir in the peas until heated through, 2 minutes. Toss in the cooked pasta, Parmesan cheese and about 1/2 cup of pasta water until the noodles are coated but the sauce is still loose. Remove from the heat and toss in the butter, chopped parsley and lemon zest. (If the sauce seems thick, adjust the consistency with the remaining pasta water). Serve immediately sprinkled with chopped parsley.\nCopyright 2010 Television Food Network, G.P.

It's creamy, cheesy, carb-y, and super super flavorful. We especially love this version because the shrimp adds lots of extra flavor and some lean protein to boot! Make sure to avoid the common mistakes listed below and you'll master this dish in no time.\nOvercooking the pasta.\nNothing is worse than a bowl of mushy pasta. We're going for\u00a0 al dente in this recipe\u2014aka it should still have some bite. This can be especially tricky when you're adding cooked pasta back to a hot pan because it will actually get cooked a little bit more. We recommend tasting your pasta for doneness a 3 to 4 minutes before the box recommends. There should still be a bit of firmness in the center of your fettuccine. That means, given a little extra cooking time in the skillet you make the sauce in, it'll come out perfectly.\u00a0\nOvercooking the shrimp.\nNever underestimate how fast shrimp can cook. Depending on their size and the heat of your pan they could cook in literally one minute, so keep an eye on them!\u00a0As soon as they turn from gray and translucent to pink and opaque, they're good to go! Set them aside on a plate and continue with the sauce. Just don't ditch anything they've left behind in the pan!\u00a0Those juices (sorry) will help flavor your sauce and make it\u00a0 so\u00a0 much better.\nCurdling the sauce.\nOne of the secrets to making an extra creamy alfredo sauce is the addition of an egg yolk. In order to incorporating that yolk without cooking it, you need to make the sauce in a specific order. After you've added your flour, add your cold milk and cream\u00a0 first , so that when you drop your yolk in, it won't start cooking immediately. When you\u00a0 do\u00a0 drop your yolk in, whisk it in to the sauce immediately and you won't have any problems. If it still sounds risky to you, you can whisk together your heavy cream, milk, and yolk and pour it into your pan as a homogenous mixture.\nUsing cheap parm.\nThis creamy sauce is totally dependent on the cheese. Most of the pre-grated parmesan cheeses sold at the grocery store are mixed with preservatives in order to prevent caking and keep the pre-grated cheese dry. Unfortunately, this can lead to a less than favorable texture, and can make it more difficult for the cheese to melt. If you can, splurge for a real piece of Parmigiano Reggiano (or another hard cheese like Locatelli or Pecorino Romano). It'll make your alfredo sauce a bit more smooth and creamy.\u00a0\nRead More +\nRead Less -\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\nYields: 4\nPrep Time: 0 hours 15 mins\nTotal Time: 0 hours 25 mins\nIngredients\n1 lb.\nfetuccine\n3 tbsp.\nbutter, divided\n1 lb.\nshrimp, peeled and deveined, tails removed\nkosher salt\nFreshly ground black pepper\n2\ncloves garlic, minced\n2 tbsp.\nall-purpose flour\n1 c.\nheavy cream\n1/2 c.\nwhole milk\n1\negg yolk\n1 c.\nfreshly grated Parmesan, plus more for garnish\n1 tbsp.\nChopped parsley, for garnish\nDirections\nCook fettuccine according to the instructions on box, reserving a cup of pasta water to thicken the sauce, if needed.\nIn a large skillet over medium heat, heat 1 tablespoon butter until melted.

Add the eggs and yolks and mix on medium speed. Turn the mixer off and scrape down the sides of the bowl, pushing the flour towards the center. Continue to mix on medium speed, repeating these steps until the dough comes together into a ball. If the dough sticks to the sides of the bowl, add flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, until it forms a cohesive ball. Knead the dough on medium-high for 3 to 4 minutes. When the dough is smooth, bright yellow in color and bounces back when pressed, transfer it to a lightly floured work surface. Knead by hand a few more times and then form into a ball. The dough should feel moist but not sticky; knead in more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, as necessary. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours but no more than 4 hours.\nFit the stand mixer with the pasta roller attachment and set to the widest setting (No. 1). Position the stand mixer with 2 to 3 feet of counter space to the left. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and divide into three portions. Work with one piece of dough at time, keeping the rest under plastic wrap so it doesn't dry out.\nWith your fingers, press a portion of the dough into a roughly 5-by-2 1/2-inch rectangle. Dust lightly with flour on both sides. Turn the mixer onto low speed and feed the dough through the roller with the 2 1/2-inch parallel to the roller. Next, fold the two ends of the dough into the center so they just meet and then fold one half over the other so the dough closes like a book; this is called laminating the dough. Use your fingers to seal the two edges together, then once again shape the dough into a 5-by-2 1/2-inch rectangle. Dust the dough with flour and feed it through the roller a second time. Repeat by laminating the dough one more time and feeding it through the roller. Dust with flour and feed through the roller three more times, dust with more flour as needed.\nAdjust the roller to setting No. 3 and feed the dough through the roller twice. Adjust to setting No. 5 and feed the dough through two more times. At this point the dough will be over a foot long. Use your right hand to feed the dough through the roller and your left hand to catch the dough. Always be very gentle with the dough to prevent tearing. Be sure to feed the dough through the machine so that it does not fold onto itself. You can make small adjustments to how the dough is entering the roller by gently guiding it to the left or right. If the dough is too long to handle, simply cut it in half and work with a smaller portion.\nFinally, adjust the roller to setting No. 7 and feed the dough through another two times. After the dough has gone through the roller for the last time, dust it all over with flour and then fold it over itself and hold under a piece of plastic wrap. Repeat these steps with the remaining two pieces of dough.\nReplace the roller attachment with the fettucine cutter attachment. Dust a baking sheet with flour. Cut the rolled dough into 12-inch pieces and feed through the fettucine cutter on low speed. Twist the fettucine into a nest and place on the prepared baking sheet. Cover with plastic wrap while you cut the remaining dough. Lightly dust the tops of the fettucine nests with flour, cover with slightly dampened paper towel and then with plastic wrap. Hold at room temperature for no more than an hour or the pasta will dry out. (Makes 1 pound pasta dough.)\nFor the chicken and broccoli alfredo: Place a baking sheet in the oven and preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.\nMix the broccoli florets with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, 1 teaspoon of the lemon zest, and salt and pepper to taste. Add the broccoli to the preheated baking sheet and roast until the lightly charred and tender, 18 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool.\nBring a large pot of water to a boil. Season with salt so that the water tastes like the ocean.\nHeat a 12-inch, high-sided pan over medium heat. Add the butter and the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Sprinkle the chicken breasts with salt and pepper. When the butter is melted, add the chicken and cook until browned and cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes per side. If the chicken has browned on both sides but isn't cooked through yet, remove to a baking sheet and finish in the oven. Let cool and then cut into 1/2-inch pieces.\nTo the same pan, add the minced garlic; cook until fragrant, 1 minute. Add the flour and stir to combine, scraping up the dark bits from the bottom of the pan. Whisk in 1 cup of the half-and-half, making sure the flour is completely combined, without any lumps. Whisk in the remaining 3 cups half-and-half, bring to a boil and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. When the mixture has thickened around the edges, but before your whisk leaves a trail behind it, add the remaining 1 teaspoon lemon zest and the Asiago and Parmesan, and whisk to combine. Turn the heat to low and season with salt and pepper. The sauce should have the consistency of a thick soup. If the sauce thickens too much, add a little of the pasta water to thin it out. Add the chicken and broccoli to the cheese sauce and hold over low heat.\nMeanwhile, cook to the pasta: Separate the strands of pasta on the baking sheet and add them to the boiling water. Cook for 30 seconds, or until the pasta floats to the top. Drain and add to the cheese sauce. Add the lemon juice and toss to combine. Garnish with parsley and serve immediately.\nMy Private Notes\nAdd a Note\nWATCH\nShow:\nValerie's Home Cooking\nEpisode:\nBe Prepared!\nCategories:\nPasta Recipes\nAlfredo\nChicken Recipes\nPoultry\nBroccoli\nMain Dish\nLooking for Something Else?\nQuick & Easy\nMore Chicken Recipes\n5 Ingredients or Less\nHighly Rated\nChicken Fettuccine Alfredo\nChicken Fettuccine Alfredo\nCajun Chicken Alfredo\nBow-Tie Skillet Alfredo\nChicken Broccoli Casserole\nChicken Stir-Fry\nChicken and Broccoli Stir-Fry\nChicken, Broccoli and Cheese Casserole\nGet the Food Network Kitchen App\n\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf73 What's Cooking\nHealthy Dinners \u2014 Fast!\nTop Cauliflower Recipes\n60+ Spring Dinners\nDiscover More Recipes...\nLet's Get Cooking!\nTo sign up, please enable JavaScript.\nSign up for the Recipe of the Day newsletter to receive editor-picked recipes, tips and videos delivered to your inbox daily.

Of course there are tons of jarred pasta sauces you can buy, but making alfredo sauce from scratch is actually so easy.\nThis is a great base recipe for all your one-pot pasta needs. Consider the following revisions when you feel like mixing it up.\nIf you're looking for a richer sauce, substitute heavy cream or half and half for the milk\u2014never a bad move.\nBig fan of dark meat? Swap in thighs for breasts ! Just make sure you give them ample cooking time. Thighs take much longer in the pan, and actually cook best with a quick trip to the oven. Our garlic butter baked chicken thighs utilize this technique, and they're BOMB.\nGet experimental with the noodles : fettuccini is a classic, but angel hair or spaghetti would work just fine! Just make sure whatever pasta you choose can be completely submerged in your cooking liquid.\nFeel like you need some veg? Stir in a couple big handfuls of spinach and some halved grape tomatoes after the pasta is cooked.\nIf you're missing crunch, toast up some panko bread crumbs in a skillet with butter and garnish with a handful. This trick works for any pasta, the added texture really takes it over the top.\nMade it?\u00a0Let us know how it went in the comment section below!\nRead More +\nRead Less -\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\nYields: 4\nPrep Time: 0 hours 10 mins\nTotal Time: 0 hours 30 mins\nIngredients\n2 tbsp.\nextra-virgin olive oil\n2\nboneless skinless chicken breasts\nKosher salt\nFreshly ground black pepper\n1 1/2 c.\nwhole milk\n1 1/2 c.\nlow-sodium chicken broth\n2\ncloves garlic, minced\n8 oz.\nfetuccini\n1/2 c.\nheavy cream\n1 c.\nfreshly grated Parmesan\nFreshly chopped parsley, for garnish\u00a0\nDirections\nIn a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat oil.

Classic Chicken Alfredo is a feel good comfort food \u2013 so creamy but light!\nThis post may contain affiliate links. Read my disclosure policy .\nMom learned how to make this \u201cPollo Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo\u201d in culinary school. She made it for us when we were kids and we were crazy about it. Now I make the same alfredo recipe for my family. It\u2019s one of my favorite comfort foods. Watch the video tutorial and learn how to make chicken alfredo.\nChicken Fettuccini Alfredo\nIngredients for Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo:\nWe usually use chicken breast but chicken tenders would work well if that is what you have on hand.\nFettuccini is the pasta of choice here but we\u2019ve been known to swap with angel hair or vermicelli. You can use a variety of pastas. P.S. sometimes we sneak in the full pound of pasta when feeding a crowd.\u00a0\nSubstitute for Half and Half?\nThis recipe calls for half and half, but you can substitute with equal parts of milk and heavy whipping cream. The half and half thickens as it simmers and even more as it rests. If you prefer a creamier or thicker sauce, you can use heavy whipping cream instead.\u00a0\nHow to Make Chicken Alfredo (Video below):\n1. Cook fettuccini in a large pot of salted water (4 qts water with 1 Tbsp salt,) according to package instructions then drain and set aside.\n2. Meanwhile, thinly slice chicken breast into strips and season all over with salt and pepper. In a large, deep skillet , heat 2 Tbsp\u00a0olive oil over medium/high heat and\u00a0saute chicken until light golden and cooked through (5 min). Remove chicken from the pan and cover to keep warm.\n3. In the same pan over medium/high, add 1 Tbsp\u00a0olive oil and 1 Tbsp butter. Add onion and saut\u00e9 3\u00a0minutes until soft. Add sliced mushrooms and saut\u00e9 until soft (5-7 min), stirring\u00a0frequently.\u00a0Add garlic and saut\u00e9 another 30 seconds until fragrant, stirring constantly.\n4. Add half-n-half and simmer over medium/high heat 8-10 min, or until just beginning to thicken. Add chicken back to pan, along with 1/4 cup parsley and season sauce to taste (1/2 to 1 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper).\n5. Add cooked pasta and stir to combine. Heat another minute until warmed through then turn off the heat, cover and let pasta rest 10-15 minutes then stir to combine and serve garnished with more parsley.\nAfter the pasta rests, you will have a creamy but light Alfredo sauce that coats the noodles perfectly.\nCreamy Pasta Recipes to Try Next:\nCreamy Shrimp Pasta \u2013 juicy shrimp in alfredo sauce\nMushroom and Leek Pasta \u2013 this sauce tastes gourmet\nChicken Pasta in Creamy Tomato Sauce \u2013 easy, excellent dinner idea\nChicken Tetrazzini \u2013\u00a0 Creamy and scrumptious pasta casserole\nWatch How to Make Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo:\nSee Natasha make her Mom\u2019s Chicken Alfredo Recipe.

We added kale in with the dish to add some green, we cooked in in the pasta water with the pasta. We served with Parmesan cheese on top. We also didn\u2019t add mushrooms.\u00a0 Reply\nNatashas Kitchen\nApril 6, 2020\nIsn\u2019t the flavor amazing for a simple recipe! Thank you for sharing that awesome review!\u00a0 Reply\nIman :)\nApril 7, 2020\nHi Natasha! Can\u2019t wait to try your recipe but just one question- how come you don\u2019t add any Italian spices?\u00a0 Reply\nNatasha's Kitchen\nApril 7, 2020\nI\u2019m excited for you to try this out. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t use Italian spices, I just prefer to use simple ingredients that others can easily find.\u00a0 Reply\nJuan\nApril 6, 2020\nI stumbled upon your recipe. It looks really good although I haven\u2019t done it yet. However I wanted to bring to your attention that in the original recipe (in the list of ingredients) it calls for 3/4 pound of pasta for 8 servings (there\u2019s no way you gonna do 3/4 lbs for 8 people, unless you are feeding 5 year-olds). 3/4s is usually for 4 people (even though like you said we can sneak in the full pound), so for 8 people you should aim at 1.5 \u2013 2 lbs of pasta. Just wanted to let you know so you can correct. I really don\u2019t know if the people who said they followed your recipe exactly actually pulled it with 3/4s while keeping the rest of the ingredients in the same proportions as indicated in the original recipe (8 servings)\u00a0 Reply\nNatashas Kitchen\nApril 6, 2020\nThank you for sharing that with me, Juan! I\u2019m so glad you found our recipes.\u00a0 Reply\nSophia\nMarch 29, 2020\nThis is by far the best chicken fettuccine alfredo recipe I have ever made. I was a little skeptical about adding onions at first because I\u2019ve never used them in Alfredo sauce, but this dish was fantastic! I did use the heavy whipping cream & added a pinch of nutmeg, but other than that, I followed the recipe as is. This will be the only recipe I use from now on. Thank you!\u00a0 Reply\nNatasha's Kitchen\nMarch 29, 2020\nThat is so great to hear, Sophia Thanks for sharing some tips too!\u00a0 Reply\nmarisa lopez\nMarch 28, 2020\nI made this tonight and it was amazing!

Perfect!!! Added pasta on top & it was so delicious!\u00a0 Reply\nNatashas Kitchen\nMarch 16, 2020\nThat\u2019s just awesome!! Thank you so much for sharing that with me.\u00a0 Reply\nChantel\nFebruary 24, 2020\nSoo yummy! I used heavy whipping cream instead of the half and half then thickened it a tiny bit, definitely saving this one! Love your recipes.\u00a0 Reply\nNatashas Kitchen\nFebruary 24, 2020\nThat\u2019s so great! Thank you for sharing that with me Chantel!\u00a0 Reply\nMonica\nFebruary 11, 2020\nHow much parmesan cheese should be added and when also what kind do you prefer?\u00a0 Reply\nNatashas Kitchen\nFebruary 11, 2020\nHi Monica, since it is a lighter sauce (half and half), we serve the finished pasta with freshly grated parmesan cheese which melts over the top when served hot.\u00a0 Reply\nSvetlana\nFebruary 2, 2020\nHello Natasha! Can I use a Parmesan cheese in this recipe? Usually Alfredo sous is with Parmesan?!!\u00a0 Reply\nNatasha's Kitchen\nFebruary 3, 2020\nYou sure can.\u00a0 Reply\nElena\nJanuary 29, 2020\nI made the chicken Alfredo and followed the directions completely but my sauce never thickened and I even used heavy cream for half of it. Do you have any idea as to what went wrong?\u00a0 Reply\nNatashas Kitchen\nJanuary 30, 2020\nHi Elena, it won\u2019t thicken the same way as a heavy whipping cream sauce as it uses light cream (half and half), but it will thicken up slightly and coat the noodles nicely once the heat is turned off and you let it sit for a few minutes. I hope you love it! Also, be sure you are using half and half and not milk.\u00a0 Reply\nElena\nJanuary 28, 2020\nI made the chicken Alfredo but my sauce was incredibly liquidity. Any ideas why it didn\u2019t thicken?

As your Family is also from europe I wanted to ask if you can tell me what I can use instead of half and half (it doesn\u2019t exist here). Lots of love Natascha\u00a0 Reply\nnatashaskitchen\nNovember 27, 2019\nHi Natascha, half and half is the same thing as equal parts of heavy whipping cream and milk. So use 1 3/4 cup of each to make half and half. You could also use heavy cream for the sauce and thin it out to taste with milk.\u00a0 Reply\nKathy Eshnaur\nNovember 26, 2019\nSauce never thickened. Half and half just doesnt do it. Adding Parmesan would have added to flavor.\u00a0 Reply\nNatashas Kitchen\nNovember 27, 2019\nHi Kathy, it won\u2019t thicken the same way as a heavy whipping cream sauce as it uses light cream (half and half), but it will thicken up slightly and coat the noodles nicely once the heat is turned off and you let it sit for a few minutes. I hope you love it! Also, be sure you are using half and half and not milk.\u00a0 Reply\nGussie Wilson\nNovember 6, 2019\nDelicious! This made a lot more than I thought! Can I freeze some?\u00a0 Reply\nNatashas Kitchen\nNovember 6, 2019\nTo be honest I haven\u2019t tried freezing it but I think it might work. I\u2019d add a little bit more cream or half and half when re-heating to make sure it isn\u2019t dry\u00a0 Reply\nPosi\nNovember 4, 2019\nHi Natasha Thanks so much for your great recipes I followed this one but the sauce curdled can you please tell me why did everything as the video\u00a0 Reply\nNatashas Kitchen\nNovember 4, 2019\nHi Posi, I haven\u2019t had that happen but I\u2019m more than happy to troubleshoot.

I enjoyed reading over your recipe and is excited to try it out for my boyfriend! I was just wondering if I can substitute the half and half for a different milk alternative such as almond milk or almond cream? Thank you.\u00a0 Reply\nNatashas Kitchen\nOctober 18, 2019\nHi Jenny, I really haven\u2019t tested anything else with this recipe that is dairy free. One of my readers recently mentioned that they use the cream from canned coconut milk to make my zuppa toscana soup recipe creamy without using milk cream, but I haven\u2019t tested that here so it\u2019s hard to recommend it here. The almond milk would not be thick enough on it\u2019s own but it may work if you add 3 Tbsp of flour after the mushrooms are cooked and saut\u00e9 the mushrooms with the flour for a couple minutes until golden then slowly add about 2 to 2 1/2 cups almond milk and bring to a simmer, whisking until it thickens. I haven\u2019t tried this method myself but I\u2019ve seen it done online. Sorry I can\u2019t be more helpful \u2013 that\u2019s my best guess!\u00a0 Reply\nJenny\nOctober 20, 2019\nHi Natasha!\nI just want to give you an update on making this delicious chicken alfredo with almond milk and it turned out really good!! The only thing is for me is that I would recommend unsweetened almond milk so that it doesn\u2019t bring out any sweet flavours and add more milk to make it more saucey. But otherwise, very good!!\u00a0 Reply\nNatashas Kitchen\nOctober 20, 2019\nI\u2019m glad you enjoyed that, Jenny! Thank you for sharing that recommendation with us.\u00a0 Reply\nJanine\nNovember 9, 2019\nI\u2019ve never heard of Alfredo sauce without any kind of cheese!

I also added Parmesan for flavor. It was okay but I\u2019ll probably try a different recipe next time\u00a0 Reply\nnatashaskitchen\nOctober 17, 2019\nHi K, this is a lighter alfredo sauce as it uses half and half or light cream. You can replace it with heavy whipping cream if you prefer a thicker sauce. I would also highly recommend our chicken in lemon cream sauce or our shrimp alfredo both of which have the rich cream sauce you might be looking for.\u00a0 Reply\nRichard\nOctober 15, 2019\nHello Natasha, thanks for the delicious recipes, I love your site!

I still prefer my gas cooktop stove because I have better heat control, but this does the job for easier filming (which is the primary reason why we purchased it). It takes a little bit to warm it up and if you overheat, it cools down slowly so be aware of that but I think it\u2019s the same for all of these little cooktops unless they are induction cooktops.\u00a0 Reply\nCelina Nagra\nFebruary 27, 2019\nHi!\nI made this but even after simmering the sauce for so long it just wouldn\u2019t thicken up.. not sure what went wrong!\u00a0 Reply\nnatashaskitchen\nFebruary 27, 2019\nHi Celina, it won\u2019t thicken the same way as a heavy whipping cream sauce as it uses light cream (half and half), but it will thicken up slightly and coat the noodles nicely once the heat is turned off and you let it sit for a few minutes.

When using a light cream (half and half), it is important to simmer the sauce until it thickens slightly or it will be too loose and won\u2019t coat the noodles easily.\u00a0 Reply\nMary Keahey\nFebruary 10, 2019\nI made this with a few modifications to make it healthier. I had never made Alfredo sauce before and it turned out great. I didn\u2019t have all the ingredients so I used spinach fettuccine, majority milk, plus half and half and cream. I also added green peas to make it a one dish meal. Very good!!\u00a0 Reply\nNatashas Kitchen\nFebruary 11, 2019\nThat sounds lovely, Mary! Thank you for that wonderful review!!!\u00a0 Reply\nMel\nFebruary 3, 2019\nDoes the sauce have to be used immediately? Looking to make it ahead and add chicken later?\u00a0 Reply\nNatashas Kitchen\nFebruary 3, 2019\nHi Mel, We like it fresh and I believe it is best that way. But it does reheat well.\u00a0 Reply\nKevin\nJanuary 20, 2019\nSome parts are a little vague. Lots of liquid when chicken is cooked. I assume you drain?? Also lot of liquid from saut\u00e9ed mushrooms. I assume you leave in? Has a good taste but a little on the bland side. Definitely needs some Parmesan and extra pepper. Maybe white pepper.\u00a0 Reply\nnatashaskitchen\nJanuary 21, 2019\nHi Kevin, I am always happy to help troubleshoot. It could be bland if there was extra liquid in the pan. Frozen chicken can give off liquid especially if you cook it and it isn\u2019t fully thawed. You would definitely want to thaw first and if you end up with liquid after cooking chicken, drain that before proceeding. Also, with mushrooms, when you sautee \u2013 in order to get a browning on the mushrooms, they will release liquid which evaporates and then they will properly brown. Hope that helps and you can add parmesan and season to taste at the end.\u00a0 Reply\nDavid\nJanuary 29, 2019\nOmg Natasha! thanks for taking the time to answer the thing about the chicken. I attempted this recipe twice so far, and both times I was wondering why the pan got so liquidy, and why the mushrooms I cook look nothing like what is shown in your video. I\u2019m going to attempt this again and drain the pan after cooking the chicken! hopefully I see results!\u00a0 Reply\nNatashas Kitchen\nJanuary 29, 2019\nYou\u2019re so welcome, David!\u00a0 Reply\nLeslie\nDecember 29, 2019\nHi Natasha.

But it does reheat well.\u00a0 Reply\nAmy\nDecember 3, 2018\n5 Stars, undoubtedly. I was a little shocked to see no parmesan in the recipe. When my son tasted it before the parm, he said it was just a bechamel sauce and while good, it wasn\u2019t Alfredo. I added a cup of freshly grated parm and it went from delicious to spectacular. I now have a house full of people talking about how good it is. I had a group of people who aren\u2019t fond of mushrooms and I KNOW it is because they haven\u2019t had a well cooked mushroom. I diced them medium fine and cook them for about an hour over a low light with some butter and olive oil with a splash of soy sauce after 30 minutes.. They become crispy, super concentrated in flavor and amazing as a topper\u2026so EVERY mushroom hater has put THOSE mushrooms on their pasta.\u00a0 Reply\nNatashas Kitchen\nDecember 3, 2018\nThat\u2019s just awesome!!

Grandma of 10\u00a0 Reply\nnatashaskitchen\nOctober 2, 2018\nHi Julie, that should work fine but keep in mind you would probably need 2 pans to cook the sauce or it would take a long time for the sauce to thicken up slightly making a double batch. To speed up the process, you could replace some of the half and half with heavy whipping cream.\u00a0 Reply\nElla Eats\nSeptember 28, 2018\nThis recipe was amazing and super easy for prep and clean up! I substituted the mushrooms with broccoli and I also added a chicken bollioun cube while saut\u00e9ing the chicken in addition to the salt and pepper. Yummy!!!

Cooking is a great way to get the little ones to eat their veggies, but you may have to get creative, finely chop the mushrooms, and if you have to, grate the onion (can\u2019t see much onion, but great flavor, and nutrients).\u00a0 Reply\nNatashas Kitchen\nAugust 14, 2018\nYes! Thank you Lee!\u00a0 Reply\nErin\nSeptember 20, 2018\nHi Katie, I\u2019m not a fan of onions either, so I dice it up into extremely tiny pieces to get the flavour without having to see myself eating it.\nYou can try using peas (if they don\u2019t mind it), or adding fresh herbs like thyme in. It\u2019s not an alfredo anymore, but at least there\u2019s a bit more than just one note.\u00a0 Reply\nNatashas Kitchen\nSeptember 20, 2018\nThank you for your great ideas, Erin!\u00a0 Reply\nDakota N.\nAugust 10, 2018\nOne of the first meals my fiance ever made me when we were dating was Fettuccine Alfredo. Tomorrow is our one year anniversary and he requested a dinner of Fettuccine Alfredo to celebrate\u2026 I had never made it before. So I spent all day today searching for a recipie to try. Landed on this one and decided to give it a try. I made it exactly to the recipie, except I added one cup of finely shredded parmesan cheese before I added the chicken and parsley at the end. It turned out AAMMAAZZIINNGG. My fiance said it\u2019s even better than the one he makes! We both are until we were bursting, and we still have 4 full servings left.

The sauce isn\u2019t as creamy as an alfredo made with heavy whipping cream \u2013 it is a lighter sauce but it should still coat the noodles. Cooking the sauce a little longer should help \ud83d\ude42 also, some of our readers chose to finish it with parmesan cheese for more creamy texture.\u00a0 Reply\nZ\nAugust 9, 2018\nHi Natasha!

I usually use his almond milk when cooking, but don\u2019t believe that it would be thick enough for this.\u00a0 Reply\nnatashaskitchen\nApril 3, 2017\nHi Karen, I really haven\u2019t tested anything else with this recipe that is dairy free. One of my readers recently mentioned that they use the cream from canned coconut milk to make my zuppa toscana soup recipe creamy without using milk cream, but I haven\u2019t tested that here so it\u2019s hard to recommend it here. The almond milk would not be thick enough on it\u2019s own but it may work if you add 3 Tbsp of flour after the mushrooms are cooked and saut\u00e9 the mushrooms with the flour for a couple minutes until golden then slowly add about 2 to 2 1/2 cups almond milk and bring to a simmer, whisking until it thickens. I haven\u2019t tried this method myself but I\u2019ve seen it done online.

Thank you \ud83d\ude42 (I agree with a comment before this would taste great with some cheese on top!)\u00a0 Reply\nnatashaskitchen\nJanuary 7, 2017\nKsusha, thank you for such a nice review and you are very welcome \ud83d\ude01.\u00a0 Reply\nVika\nOctober 31, 2016\nGreat recipe!! Natasha, you never disappoint. I usually put parmesan cheese whenever i make any alfredo dish but I ran out. Even though this recipe didn\u2019t call for parmesan cheese i still would have added it. Well good thing i ran out because now i know that it\u2019s tasty either way! \ud83d\ude42\u00a0 Reply\nnatashaskitchen\nNovember 1, 2016\nVika, thank you for the wonderful review on the recipe \ud83d\ude01. After reading your comment, I know what to make this week \ud83d\ude0b.\u00a0 Reply\nLauren\nJuly 13, 2016\nTasty and filling, we had this with brussel sprouts as our vegetable tonight. Will make again.\u00a0 Reply\nnatashaskitchen\nJuly 14, 2016\nOh wow that sounds really great with brussels sprouts! Thanks for sharing your great review \ud83d\ude42\u00a0 Reply\nFatima\nJune 20, 2016\nHi , I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ve done wrong but just made the Alfredo and it tastes a bit bland .. What can I add?\u00a0 Reply\nnatashaskitchen\nJune 20, 2016\nHi Fatima, if everything else was done to the recipe, I always add more salt and pepper to taste in step 5.\u00a0 Reply\nFatima\nJune 19, 2016\nHey , just a quick question , will be making this tomorrow .Can I make this with a short pasta ?\u00a0 Reply\nnatashaskitchen\nJune 19, 2016\nI think it works best with the long noodles because it is a thinner sauce but I think it could also work fine with a short pasta.\u00a0 Reply\nAlina\nJanuary 29, 2016\nThis was delicious! I just made this for dinner! So quick and easy! I used store bought rotisserie chicken instead of making my own because I was short on time. Was delicious, everyone liked it! I used half milk, half heavy whip cream and had no problem with it thickening up. Was runny at first but thickened up really nice while simmering. Thank you for the recipe!\u00a0 Reply\nnatashaskitchen\nJanuary 29, 2016\nAlina, thank you for the great review and nice job improvising .\ud83d\ude00\u00a0 Reply\nalla\nJanuary 22, 2016\nThank you for your recipes, for ideas!

I\u2019ve just gotten into cooking and i love the recipes you post. I\u2019ve made this for 2 family dinners so far and everyone loves it. thank you so much!\u00a0 Reply\nnatashaskitchen\nOctober 14, 2015\nJake, thank you for the great review :). I\u2019m glad everyone loves it. Your comment is making me hungry for some Fettuccine Alfredo :D.\u00a0 Reply\nChantelle\nJune 18, 2014\nThis recipe was great! Although, I did have to add 2 tablespoons of flour for it to actually thicken. But for my first time making it, my boyfriend and roommate loved it!\u00a0 Reply\nnatashaskitchen\nJune 18, 2014\nI\u2019m so glad you enjoyed it! \ud83d\ude42\u00a0 Reply\nLucy\nApril 22, 2014\nI made this tonight. Delicious!!!!!! This is our go-to alfredo now. Thanks!!!\u00a0 Reply\nnatashaskitchen\nApril 22, 2014\nThat\u2019s awesome! It has been our families go-to for years \ud83d\ude42\u00a0 Reply\nVika\nApril 1, 2014\nMe and my family really liked this recipe. It\u2019s going into our rotation! Thank you!!

I\u2019m so happy to hear you enjoyed the recipe. \ud83d\ude42 Thanks for a great review!\u00a0 Reply\nAna\nJanuary 22, 2014\nWill this work with heavy cream or does it have to be heavy whipping cream ? For some reason my sauce is not thinking up\u00a0 Reply\nAna\nJanuary 22, 2014\nSorry my phone \u201ccorrected\u201d it for me . I meant thickening up. But I think I just needed to simmer it a little longer , seemed to work . Letting it cool a little and we\u2019ll see. Thank you\u00a0 Reply\nnatashaskitchen\nJanuary 22, 2014\nNo worries \ud83d\ude42 I hope it turned out well. You probably found that it thickens up a little more when it cools down. It\u2019s not supposed to be thick and creamy, but a little lighter with half-n-half. I hope you loved it! If you\u2019re looking for a thicker pasta sauce, I\u2019d also highly recommend this mushroom and leek pasta recipe \u00a0 Reply\nTanya Sem\nDecember 19, 2013\nI would like to say that this recipe deserves much more than 5 stars!!!!! I love it so much, I could eat it and eat it, but that wouldn\u2019t be too nice on my waist \ud83d\ude09 Thanks so much for the recipe! It\u2019s definitely my go-to recipe, and your blog is my lifesaver! Thanks so much for all you do Natasha! Merry Christmas! Hope that you have a very merry one! God bless you and your beautiful family!\u00a0 Reply\nnatashaskitchen\nDecember 19, 2013\nAwww thanks so much Tanya \ud83d\ude42 You know, if you like this one so much, I think you\u2019d also really enjoy this mushroom leek pasta .\u00a0 Reply\nTanya Sem\nDecember 20, 2013\nThanks! I\u2019ll have to try it out!\u00a0 Reply\nTanya Sem\nJanuary 29, 2014\nDo you think that this will freeze good if I made a lot and wanted to save it for a later time?\u00a0 Reply\nnatashaskitchen\nJanuary 29, 2014\nTo be honest I haven\u2019t tried freezing it but I think it might work. I\u2019d add a little bit more cream or half and half when re-heating to make sure it isn\u2019t dry.\u00a0 Reply\nlily\nMay 13, 2013\nWhat if i don\u2019t want the mushrooms in the recipe?\u00a0 Reply\nnatashaskitchen\nMay 14, 2013\nYou can skip them :).\u00a0 Reply\nChelsea\nMarch 19, 2013\nI haven\u2019t tried this yet and I\u2019ve never made homemade alfredo but I would like to add broccoli as well. Would I just add it in at the same time as the mushrooms or should I cook it separately? I don\u2019t want to mess it up!\u00a0 Reply\nnatashaskitchen\nMarch 19, 2013\nI would cook it separately until done and just add it on top of the pasta once its served.\u00a0 Reply\nChelsea\nMarch 20, 2013\nThank you! I\u2019m trying it tonight, can\u2019t wait\u00a0 Reply\nAngie\nJanuary 30, 2013\nIs there a way to make this recipe without mushrooms?\u00a0 Reply\nnatashaskitchen\nJanuary 30, 2013\nYes; it won\u2019t quite taste the same, but it can be done without mushrooms.\u00a0 Reply\nMarina\nDecember 27, 2012\nHi Natasha, I made this last night and it was so delicious and easy to make, my brother was visiting and he just eat 2 bowls of it \ud83d\ude42 I\u2019m beyond thankful for your blog and your easy instructions.

I\u2019ve heard that from other readers as well. Can\u2019t wait to try it!\u00a0 Reply\nAlla\nNovember 7, 2012\nIs the reason you have heavy cream and milk in pic is bc thats what you used to substitutte for half&half? Half cream and half milk? I was just wondering\u2026.\u00a0 Reply\nnatashaskitchen\nNovember 7, 2012\nYes, that\u2019s exactly it! Sorry forgot to add that to the instructions that you can substitute. Thanks!\u00a0 Reply\nnatalie\nNovember 7, 2012\nFinish it with parmesan cheese for more creamy texture.\u00a0 Reply\nnatashaskitchen\nNovember 7, 2012\nThank you! Next time \ud83d\ude09\u00a0 Reply\nLena\nNovember 1, 2012\nNatasha, this is the first time I\u2019m writing a note on your site but I\u2019ve been making food with your recipes for a while now. I just wanted to say that I love your site and think that you do such a wonderful job explaining your recipes and the fact that you have pics for every step is such a big help! It just makes things so much easier. I know right away if I\u2019m doing it right. Thank you and may God bless you and your family. I hope you keep finding time to post new recipes. \ud83d\ude42\u00a0 Reply\nnatashaskitchen\nNovember 1, 2012\nYou are so welcome Lena, blessing to your family as well \ud83d\ude42\u00a0 Reply\nOlgita\nOctober 23, 2012\nMade this today; it was really good. My mom loved it too!\u00a0 Reply\nnatashaskitchen\nOctober 23, 2012\nThank you! I\u2019m so glad you both enjoyed it. We are planning to work on updating the pictures tomorrow (long overdue!) \ud83d\ude42\u00a0 Reply\nNelly\nJune 28, 2012\nThank you for sharing this wonderful dish! The cream definitely beats the canned Alfredo sauce I used to buy at the store. I also really like how you give credit to your friends for the recipes.\u00a0 Reply\nIrina\nDecember 21, 2011\nHi Natasha. So how creamy exactly is the sauce supposed to get? Mine was still kind of runny even after I let it cool down a bit. Maybe this recipe would be better with heavy whipping cream instead of half & half. It would probably be much richer and more calories of course \ud83d\ude09 Thanks.\u00a0 Reply\nnatashaskitchen\nDecember 21, 2011\nIt may have needed a couple more minutes of cooking. I\u2019ll have to post a heavy whipping cream version one of these days (I am a sucker for creamy pastas). This is definitely a lighter version but a little trickier in terms of cooking time.\u00a0 Reply\nIrina\nDecember 24, 2011\nI love creamy pasta also \ud83d\ude09 But this one wasn\u2019t too creamy for me, so next time will definitely try it with whipping cream instead. Still a wonderful recipe. Thank you!\u00a0 Reply\nLena\nMarch 16, 2013\nWell, it\u2019s says half and half in the recipe, but you have heavy whipping cream in the picture.\u00a0 Reply\nnatashaskitchen\nMarch 16, 2013\nSorry I added that little tid-bit to the instructions; you can use either half and half or equal parts milk and heavy whipping cream.\nTamara\nDecember 13, 2011\nHow much salt to you add to the water you cook the pasta in? My cousin works at an Italian restaurant and says you have to make the water almost as salty as salt water.\u00a0 Reply\nnatashaskitchen\nDecember 14, 2011\nIt depends on the type of pot you use. In a medium pot, I would use 1 to 1 1/2 tsp salt. In a large pot, I\u2019d use closer to a tbsp.\u00a0 Reply\nDina\nAugust 19, 2011\nI made this yesterday and it turned out delishious. My husbend esp. like the creamy mushroom taste. I loved it too, but I must admit I felt a little guilty eating it, since it\u2019s pretty rich. Definitly a comfort food, will make it again.\u00a0 Reply\nnatashaskitchen\nFebruary 18, 2013\nI\u2019m glad you like the recipe Dina :).\u00a0 Reply\nLils\nJuly 11, 2011\nCan I use milk instead of half and half?\u00a0 Reply\nNatashasKitchen.com\nJuly 11, 2011\nI don\u2019t think it will work. I think Milk is too thin for this recipe.\u00a0 Reply\nLils\nJuly 11, 2011\nThank you\u00a0 Reply\nAnna\nNovember 7, 2012\nIf you want to use milk, you just need to make a roux first, then incorporate the milk. Melt 2 tablespoons butter, add 2 tablespoons flour then cook over low heat and whisk in the milk slowly so there are not clumps, then add to recipe \ud83d\ude42\u00a0 Reply\nnatashaskitchen\nNovember 7, 2012\nAnna; thanks for the tip!\u00a0 Reply\nAdd comment/review\nLeave a comment Cancel reply\nRecipe Rating\nComment\nName *\nEmail *\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\nWelcome to our family food blog!\nHi!

It\u2019s absolutely decadent, made with a cashew cream sauce, and the sauce is made easily in your blender!\nWhere do I start? You\u2019re going to absolutely love and want to devour this Vegan Garlic Alfredo Pasta. I\u2019m talking cheesy, creamy, absolutely indulgent in taste kind of pasta dinner. The kind of dinner that totally hits the spot, and makes you want to curl up on a Friday night. Without the heavy feeling, of course. All my pasta cravings are hereby conquered.\nFirst things first \u2013 I haven\u2019t been a big pasta fanatic. LET me be clear. When a pasta dish is done well \u2013 I am all for that. If you\u2019re a vegetarian or a vegan though, you know that\u00a0 lots of pasta dishes just are\u00a0 not done correctly. Kind of a leftover, oh yeah whoops, kind of scenario, and it can drive you to never want to have pasta again.\nWHAT a terrible nightmarish scenario. Fortunately, after making this Vegan Garlic Alfredo Pasta, I now know I have the best pasta dish sitting and waiting at home on me! You\u2019re going to want to grab some cashews right now so that you can make this for dinner, friends.\nLet\u2019s talk key ingredients. That roasted garlic is a\u00a0 must . I mean, it deepens the flavour of the entire sauce, and really brings it to another level. You\u2019re going to have to wait for your cashews to soak anyway, so you might as well make it. I guarantee it\u2019ll change all of your dishes.\nSpeaking of which, cashews. OMG. Adding soaked cashews to this sauce makes it so creamy and gives it that traditional white colour. No, the sauce won\u2019t taste like cashews, thanks to the addition of another ingredient: lemon or lime juice. This acid helps to neutralise the cashew flavour so all you taste is the cheesiness.\nThe nutritional yeast and the vegan parmesan cheese! I speak all about nutritional yeast here , and I made a vegan parmesan cheese for you here. You can also buy your vegan parm though, so it\u2019s totally up to you. That extra bit of tanginess really ups the sauce, and you can add eons of it on top too. The nutritional yeast in the Alfredo sauce gives it that cheesy flavour, that will have you taste testing the heck out of this sauce.\nAlmond milk and pasta water! Don\u2019t use regular water! Pasta water already has some saltiness, some starch, and is a perfectly seasoned form of water in this sauce. The almond milk of course adds more creaminess.\nBasically what I\u2019m saying is, friends, every ingredient is key here. Including the cooked down onions (adding a nice flavour + umami). What you get is a beautiful vegan Alfredo sauce recipe made in your blender that you can pour back on your pasta and then dig in. The kind of sauce you\u2019ll probably want to put on anything, but will definitely slather all over your pasta.\nThat\u2019s it! Your pasta dreams have come true! Dive in friends, and enjoy!\n\u00a0\nVegan Garlic Alfredo Pasta\nby: Jessica in the Kitchen\nPrep Time 1\nminute\nCook Time 15\nminutes\nTotal Time 16\nminutes\nCourse Dinner, Lunch\nKeyword Dairy Free, Egg Free, Nut Free, Soy Free, vegan, Vegetarian\nPrint\nShare\nFacebook\nTwitter\nGoogle+\nPinterest\nYummly\nTumblr\nEmail\n5 from 3 votes\nIngredients\nPasta\n12\nounces\nany pasta\nI used fettuccine\nchopped parsley\nfor garnish\nVegan Alfredo Sauce\n2\nteaspoons\nvegan butter or olive oil\n1/2\nred onion\nchopped\n1\ncup\ncashews\nsoaked overnight, or in hot water for one hour\n1/4\ncup\npasta water\n1 \u00bd\ncups\nunsweetened almond milk\n4\ncloves\nroasted garlic*\n2\ntablespoons\nnutritional yeast\n\u00bd\nteaspoon\nsea salt\n2\ntablespoons\nvegan parmesan cheese + extra for topping\n1\ntablespoon\nlime juice\nInstructions\nInstructions\nCook pasta according to package directions in a well salted pot of water.

Add the rinsed off soaked cashews (without the water), the pasta water, the almond milk, the roasted garlic, the nutritional yeast, the sea salt the vegan parmesan cheese and the lime juice.

Taste and add more salt or vegan parmesan cheese if necessary.\nWhen the pasta is finished boiling, drain and pour back into the pan you had used earlier or even into a Tupperware container if you want. Pour the Alfredo sauce over and stir to combine completely.\nWhen serving, top with parsley to garnish and more vegan parmesan cheese. Enjoy!\nVideo\nNOTES\n*YES roasted garlic takes about 40 minutes, but you\u2019ll need to wait for your cashews to soak for an hour at least anyway! Cut a bit of the tops off of a whole head of garlic, put it in foil, drizzle olive oil on it, wrap the foil around it and cook it at 450 degrees F for 45 minutes in your oven until the cloves are soft and velvety! Allow it to cool, then push the cloves out.\n\u00a0\nYou can reheat this! Just reheat it in a stove top over medium high heat with a bit more almond milk to thin it out again until hot.\nPrep time doesn\u2019t include soaking the cashews overnight.\nby Jessica\n_-jbxMmYlqE\nShare This Post\nPost navigation\n\u2039\u2039 Older Posts\nNewer Posts \u203a\u203a\nYou Might Also Like\nChocolate Chia Pudding (5 Ingredients, Vegan, Low Carb)\nRead More\nHow To Make Cashew Cream (The Ultimate Dairy Free Substitute)\nRead More\nEasy Grilled Pineapples (aka Caramelised Pineapples)\nRead More\nleave a comment Cancel reply\nRecipe Rating\n40 comments\nComment navigation\nOlder Comments\nErica\nsays:\nI\u2019m allergic to cashews, what would you suggest?\nDecember 10, 2018\nReply\nJessica\nsays:\nHi Erica,\nMaybe macadamia nuts?

I tried one other recipe in the past with cauliflower and didn\u2019t really care for it. This sauce was exactly what I hoped for. I added a ton of black pepper, which gave it a cacio e pape feel. I served it over Banza chickpea shells with Beyond Meat sausage and broccoli all mixed together. People ask if I feel deprived eating veggie/vegan and it\u2019s sauces like this that make it easy to say no!

The onion and roasted garlic give the sauce depth of flavor and the nutritional yeast and vegan Parmesan make this sauce absolutely decadent. My only variation was to use oat milk in place of almond milk and it worked perfectly. This sauce will keep in the fridge for several days and actually tastes better when the flavors are left to meld a bit.\nI will NEVER go back to dairy-based Alfredo.

The sauce is so cheezy it\u2019s hard to believe there\u2019s no cheese in it. I added a bit of full-fat coconut milk for extra creaminess, and stirred in some sauteed mushrooms at the very end. My husband loved it so much he went back for thirds. Thanks for this delicious recipe!

How long can i keep it in the fridge. X\nApril 19, 2020\nReply\nGavin | Jessica in the Kitchen\nsays:\nHi Natalie thank u so much for your kind review!

I tried one other recipe in the past with cauliflower and didn\u2019t really care for it. This sauce was exactly what I hoped for. I added a ton of black pepper, which gave it a cacio e pape feel. I served it over Banza chickpea shells with Beyond Meat sausage and broccoli all mixed together. People ask if I feel deprived eating veggie/vegan and it\u2019s sauces like this that make it easy to say no! Thank you.\nApril 4, 2019\nReply\nchloe\nsays:\nshould i use pre squeezed lime juice from a bottle, or should i buy a fresh lime and squeeze it myself?\nApril 10, 2019\nReply\nJessica\nsays:\nHi Chloe,\nFresh lime would be best! I hope that helps!!\nApril 10, 2019\nReply\nClare\nsays:\nThis recipe is everything it promises and more! The onion and roasted garlic give the sauce depth of flavor and the nutritional yeast and vegan Parmesan make this sauce absolutely decadent. My only variation was to use oat milk in place of almond milk and it worked perfectly. This sauce will keep in the fridge for several days and actually tastes better when the flavors are left to meld a bit.\nI will NEVER go back to dairy-based Alfredo. This is my new \u201cgo-to\u201d recipe for a velvety, cheesy, satisfying sauce!\nJuly 23, 2019\nReply\nCourtney | Jessica in the Kitchen\nsays:\nHi Clare! that substitution does sound yummy! We\u2019re so happy you enjoyed! Thanks for taking the time to share! ?\nJuly 24, 2019\nReply\nMadison\nsays:\nwould it be ok if I used cashews that weren\u2019t raw and didn\u2019t soak them? I\u2019m not close to a store that sells raw cashews, they\u2019re always roasted.\nDecember 3, 2019\nReply\nJessica\nsays:\nHi Madison,\nI haven\u2019t tried roasted cashews, so I can\u2019t guarantee, but I don\u2019t see why it wouldn\u2019t work! As long as they aren\u2019t salted! I hope you enjoy! \ud83d\ude42\nDecember 3, 2019\nReply\nMaria\nsays:\nThis recipe is divine!!! The sauce is so cheezy it\u2019s hard to believe there\u2019s no cheese in it. I added a bit of full-fat coconut milk for extra creaminess, and stirred in some sauteed mushrooms at the very end. My husband loved it so much he went back for thirds. Thanks for this delicious recipe! I\u2019d give it 6 stars if i could. \ud83d\ude09\nJanuary 29, 2020\nReply\nGavin | Jessica in the Kitchen\nsays:\nWow thank you so much Maria! We\u2019re so happy that you and your husband enjoyed it! We hope you have a great day!\nJanuary 30, 2020\nReply\nNatalie\nsays:\nHi, this sauce is amazing. Thank you for the recipe. Even my pickiest eater loved it. Husband included and they don\u2019t like to try new things. Didn\u2019t tell them what they were eating. I have some extra sauce. How long can i keep it in the fridge. X\nApril 19, 2020\nReply\nGavin | Jessica in the Kitchen\nsays:\nHi Natalie thank u so much for your kind review! The sauce will keep in the fridge comfortably for 5- 7 days. I really hope this helps!\nApril 19, 2020\nReply\nComment navigation\nOlder Comments\nin the kitchen everyday\nNew on the blog is this Hummus Pasta\ud83c\udf5d!
