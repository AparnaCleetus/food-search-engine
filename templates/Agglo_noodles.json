It can be made from whole wheat flour or all purpose flour. Usually noodles are cooked al dente, but for some recipes I prefer to cook them till they are softened, since I do not cook them further after mixing with veggies.\nThe method listed here will give you non sticky noodles that can be used in any noodle recipes like Hakka noodles , Schezwan noodles , Chow mein \u00a0and\u00a0 Chilli garlic noodles .\nSome Indo Chinese recipes are made with fried noodles as one of the main ingredients. E.g Chinese bhel and American chopsuey . for such recipes you can check this detailed Recipe post on how to fry noodles .\nStepwise method for making non sticky boiled noodles\n1. Heat 5 to 6 cups water in a pan.\n2. Bring the water to a boil.\n3.\u00a0then add \u00bd teaspoon salt.\n4. Next add \u00bd teaspoon oil. Mix well.\n5. Then add 150 grams noodles.\n6. Boil the noodles on medium to high flame till they are cooked well.\n7. Check the doneness of noodles by pressing a few noodles or tasting them. They should be softened. You can even cook the noodles till al dente if you plan to stir fry the noodles for some more minutes later. For an al dente texture, there will be a slight bite in the cooked noodles. Do note that not to over cook the noodles. They will end up becoming sticky and\u00a0lumpy.\n8. Once the noodles are cooked well, drain them in a colander or sieve.\n9.

If you want you can even drizzle 1 to 2 teaspoons of oil and mix it gently with the noodles.\n11.

This recipe of Chinese bhel is too delicious and tastes exactly like a street style chaat snack.\nGet My Secrets to Great Indian Food\nSign up for my FREE Beginners Guide to Delicious Indian Cooking\nIn Chinese bhel, fried crispy noodles are used with stir fried veggies and a few sauces. When I make Chinese bhel I prefer to use sweet tamarind chutney as it gives a really nice sour and sweet taste in the bhel.\nTo make this bhel you need to use three different types of sauces or chutneys \u2013 a spicy sauce, a sweet sauce and a tangy or sour sauce. You can even use green chutney or red chili chutney\u00a0or schezwan sauce.\nTo make Chinese bhel\nThe sauces I have used are soy sauce (naturally fermented), sweet tamarind chutney and sriracha sauce. Instead of sriracha sauce you can use red chilli sauce or sweet chilli sauce. Instead of sweet tamarind chutney you can use tomato ketchup. In fact you can use a combination of your favorite sauces.\nYou can add veggies of your choice.

So once in a while if you make then its fine when the kids ask for it.

Stir the corn flour paste (as the corn flour settles down) and then add slowly in a stream in the pan.\n41. As soon as you add corn flour paste, quickly stir so that lumps are not formed. In case lumps do form, then use a wired whisk and stir the gravy (sauce).\n42. Season with salt as per taste. Add less salt as the sauces already have salt in them.\n43. Add \u00bc teaspoon black pepper powder or crushed black pepper. Mix very well.\n44. Simmer on a low to medium flame for 2 to 3 minutes till the sauce thicken. Check the taste and the corn flour\u2019s raw taste should not be there.\n45. Now add 1 teaspoon rice vinegar or apple cider vinegar or white vinegar. You can also add lemon juice in place of vinegar. Add \u00bd to 1 teaspoon lemon juice.\n46. Add \u00bd to 1 teaspoon sugar. You can add less or more sugar as required.

If they come up too quickly then the oil is very hot, so the flame need to be reduced.\nAdd noodles in batches.\nAs soon as you add noodles, then with a slotted spoon separate them.\nFry till the base become light golden and crisp.\nThen turn over and fry the second side till crisp and light golden.\nTurn over a couple of times and fry till the noodles become golden.\nRemove fried noodles with a slotted spoon draining excess oil in the kadai or pan.\nPlace fried noodles on kitchen paper towels so that extra oil is absorbed. This way fry the noodles in batches.\u00a0\nOnce cooled, then place the crispy fried noodles in an air-tight container.\npreparation to make chopsuey sauce\nShred or finely chop the veggies. You can use a food processor or chop the veggies with a knife.\u00a0\nIn a small bowl, take 3 tablespoons tomato ketchup, 1 tablespoon soy sauce and \u00bd tablespoon sweet red chilli sauce or sriracha sauce.\nMix the three sauces very well with a spoon.\nIn another small bowl take 2 tablespoons corn flour and 2 tablespoons water.\u00a0mix very well.\nmaking chopsuey sauce\nHeat 1 tablespoon sesame oil in a wok or kadai or a pan. You can also use peanut oil or sunflower oil. Keep the flame to low to medium.\nAdd \u00bd teaspoon finely chopped ginger and \u00bd teaspoon finely chopped garlic.\nSaute for some seconds till the raw aroma of both ginger and garlic goes away.\nNow add \u00bc cup chopped spring onions.\u00a0\nIncrease the heat to medium or high and stir fry onions for a minute.\nNow add the shredded veggies.\u00a0mix very well.\nStir fry vegetables on medium to high flame for 4 to 5 minutes.\nNow reduce the flame and add the sauces.\u00a0mix very well with the stir fried veggies.\nAdd 1.5 to 1.75 cups water and mix well.\nStir the corn flour paste (as the corn flour settles down) and then add slowly in a stream in the pan.\nAs soon as you add corn flour paste, quickly stir so that lumps are not formed. In case lumps do form, then use a wired whisk and stir the gravy (sauce).\nSeason with salt as per taste. Add less salt as the sauces already have salt in them.\nAdd \u00bc teaspoon black pepper powder or crushed black pepper. Mix very well.\nSimmer on a low to medium flame for 2 to 3 minutes till the sauce thickens. Check the taste and the corn flour's raw taste should not be there.\nNow add 1 teaspoon rice vinegar or apple cider vinegar or white vinegar.\nAdd \u00bd to 1 teaspoon sugar. You can add less or more sugar as required. Check the taste before adding sugar and if required then only add sugar. Mix very well.\nSwitch off the flame and now add 2 tablespoons spring onion greens.\nMix well. The chop suey sauce is ready to be served. Check the final taste and add salt, sugar, black pepper, soy sauce or any of the sauces if required.\nmaking american chopsuey\nNow break the fried noodles and take them in 2 to 3 serving plates or bowls. I usually break the fried noodles. You can even keep them as one whole lot of fried noodles.\nTop the crispy noodles with the chop suey sauce as required.\nGarnish with a few spring onion greens. You can even garnish with some chopped coriander leaves.\nServe veg american chopsuey immediately.\nNutrition Info (approximate values)\nNutrition Facts\nAmerican Chop Suey\nAmount Per Serving\nCalories 594\nCalories from Fat 198\n% Daily Value*\nFat 22g 34%\nSaturated Fat 3g 19%\nSodium 1695mg 74%\nPotassium 501mg 14%\nCarbohydrates 90g 30%\nFiber 2g 8%\nSugar 11g 12%\nProtein 14g 28%\nVitamin A 6017IU 120%\nVitamin B1 (Thiamine) 1mg 67%\nVitamin B2 (Riboflavin) 1mg 59%\nVitamin B3 (Niacin) 5mg 25%\nVitamin B6 1mg 50%\nVitamin C 32mg 39%\nVitamin E 7mg 47%\nVitamin K 105\u00b5g 100%\nCalcium 88mg 9%\nVitamin B9 (Folate) 81\u00b5g 20%\nIron 4mg 22%\nMagnesium 133mg 33%\nPhosphorus 232mg 23%\nZinc 2mg 13%\n* Percent Daily Values are based on a 2000 calorie diet.\nGOOD KARMA all our content & photos are copyright protected. a lot of time and effort is spent in researching, developing, testing and photographing recipes. please do not copy. as a blogger, if you you want to adapt this recipe or make a youtube video, then please write the recipe in your own words and give a clickable link back to the recipe on this url.\nTRIED THIS RECIPE ? i would love to hear from you. if you have made this recipe then rate the recipe or leave a comment below. if you like this recipe then do share the recipe link on facebook, twitter & pinterest. for instagram mention @vegrecipesofindia or tag #vegrecipesofindia\nCategories Indian Chinese , Noodles , Street Food Recipes , Vegan Recipes\nPost navigation\nTrending Recipes\nEasy Pani Puri\nBhatura Recipe (Bhature without yeast)\n50 tasty besan recipes (gram flour or chickpea flour recipes)\n30 Popular Indian Breakfast Recipes for Foodies\n65 Whole Wheat recipes | Tasty recipes with whole wheat flour (Chapati Atta)\nbest gulab jamun \u2013 2 ways\n35 Best Indian Rice Recipes\nhow to make cake without oven | cake recipes without oven\noats recipes | 14 oatmeal recipes | easy oats recipes for breakfast or snack\npuri recipe for golgappa or pani puri or puchka\nSoft Whole Wheat Bread | 100% Wholemeal Bread from Scratch (Eggless)\nBest Punjabi Samosa Recipe\nyogurt recipes | curd recipes | 30 indian recipes with yogurt or curd\nchivda recipe\ncooker cake | sponge cake in pressure cooker\nWhole Wheat Banana Cake (Eggless and Vegan)\nmomos recipe | dim sum | veg momos\n20 popular indian dinner recipes | lunch recipes\nEggless Chocolate Cake (Whole Wheat)\n20 easy and simple eggless cakes recipes\nPaneer Butter Masala (Restaurant Style)\nrava recipes | 35 sooji recipes | sweets and snacks made with semolina\n21 ripe banana recipes | easy banana dessert recipes\nEasy No Yeast Pizza Dough (Vegan)\n91 delicious paneer recipes\nTomato Puree (Homemade & Without Preservatives)\nwheat cake | eggless wheat flour cake\nGet My Secrets to Great Indian Food\nSign up for my FREE Beginners Guide to Delicious Indian Cooking\nDassana Amit\nnamaste and welcome to vegrecipesofindia.com which i started in feb 2009 and is a pure vegetarian blog. i have been passionate about cooking from childhood and began to cook from the age of 10. later having enrolled in a home science degree greatly enhanced my cooking & baking skills and took it to a different level which i now share as foolproof recipes. i was formally trained both in mainstream indian as well as international cuisines.\nAbout Dassana Amit\nComments are closed.\n16 comments\/reviews\nKaashvi\nFeb 18, 2018\nPlease make a version of Maggi.

recipe\nshavige uppittu recipe | shavige bath recipe | shavige upma recipe\nBy\nHebbars Kitchen\n-\nFebruary 6, 2020\nthis post is also available in \u0c95\u0ca8\u0ccd\u0ca8\u0ca1 (Kannada) , and \u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940 (Hindi)\nshavige uppittu recipe | shavige bath recipe | shavige upma recipe with detailed photo and video recipe. a simple and easy karnataka style breakfast recipe made with rice vermicelli and spices. it is a very common breakfast recipe made across south indian state, if not all indian states. it is typically served as it is without any accompaniment but tastes great when served with spicy coconut chutney or with thin poha avalakki .\nshavige uppittu recipe | shavige bath recipe | shavige upma recipe with step by step photo and video recipe. breakfast recipes are one of the most common recipes requested frequently from my readers. it has to be quick, tasty, at the same time provide all the required nutritional benefits. one such easy and simple breakfast recipe is shavige uppittu or shavige bath made with thin rice vermicelli noodles.\nthis is one such recipe, which was due to me since ages. the main reason i was not able to post it due to the availability of thin rice vermicelli noodles in my place. we do have some variation in my local indian grocery shop, but i wasn\u2019t happy with the quality of it. hence it got backlogged for forever. however, during our last annual trip to india, my husband ensured to shop the anil akki shavige from india. this is not just for video posting, but also for the day to day morning breakfast. he likes the thin shavige uppittu and also it has to be non-sticky. most of the local brands typically turn mushy once it is boiled and hence we stopped buying it. moreover, we also tried our luck with some asian grocerry but wasn\u2019t satisfactory.\nfurthermore, i would like to add some tips, suggestions and variations to this shavige uppittu recipe . firstly, you need to extra careful while boiling the noodles in water. do not overcook it, and also you can add a tsp of cooking oil to make it non-sticky. also, once it is cooked, you can also run it over cold water to stop cooking. secondly, you get different types of shavige or noodles from different brands. for instance, you have semolina based, ragi based and also lentil-based. you can use the same recipe to make different types of shavige. lastly, the shavige upma recipe tastes good when served with a spicy chutney recipe. preferably, coconut chutney \u00a0or tomato chutney or veg kurma should be an ideal combination.\nfinally, i request you to check my other indian breakfast recipes collection with this post of shavige uppittu recipe . it mainly includes recipes like lemon rice , pudina rice , fada ni khichdi , vegetable uttapam , methi dosa , rava rotti , eggless bread omelette , rava dosa , ghee roast dosa , poha uttapam . further to these i would also like to highlight my other recipes

A spicy, sweet and sour gravy that tastes great with veg fried rice or veg noodles or hakka noodles. I have also shared a starter snack of crispy Baby corn manchurian before.\nIn this Indo Chinese baby corn manchurian gravy recipe you can shallow fry or deep fry baby corn. Sometimes I pan fry them also. For this recipe post to save time, I have deep fried them.\nGet My Secrets to Great Indian Food\nSign up for my FREE Beginners Guide to Delicious Indian Cooking\nIn the recipe you can add less or more of the sauces as per your requirements.\nIt can be served with a rice dish like veg fried rice\u00a0or\u00a0burnt garlic fried rice\u00a0or 5 spice rice\u00a0or jeera rice or even plain steamed rice.\nHow to make gravy version of baby corn manchurian\nA) frying baby corn\n1. Rinse and then chop 250 grams baby corn in 2 to 3 pieces. If they are small in size then no need to chop them.\n2. Take the chopped baby corn in a mixing bowl. Add \u00bc teaspoon black pepper and \u00bc teaspoon salt\u2028 or add as per taste.\n3. Then add 2 tablespoons corn flour (corn starch).\n4. Mix very well.\n5. Heat oil as required in a kadai or pan. You can deep fry or shallow fry the baby corn. Check the oil temperature by adding one piece of baby corn. It should gradually come on top. Then the oil is ready for frying. If it stays at the bottom the oil is not hot enough, so increase the flame. If it comes up too quickly, the oil has become very hot, so reduce the flame.\n6. Add the baby corn pieces.\n7. Begin to fry at medium flame. When one side is crisp and light golden, turn over and fry the second side.\n8. Flip a couple of times and fry till the baby corn pieces become golden and crisp.\n9. Remove with a slotted spoon.\n10. Place fried baby corn on kitchen paper towels. Continue to fry this way in batches.\nB) making corn flour paste\n11. In a small bowl take 2 tablespoons corn flour (corn starch).\n12. Add 2 tablespoon water.\n13. Mix very well to form a smooth paste. Keep aside.\n14. In another pan heat 2 tablespoons oil (sesame or peanut or sunflower oil). Then add 1 teaspoon finely chopped ginger, 2 teaspoons finely chopped garlic and 1 teaspoon finely chopped green chilies.\n15. Saute for one minute on a low flame or till the raw aroma of both ginger and garlic goes away.\n16. Next add \u2153 cup chopped spring onions.\n17. Stir fry on medium to high flame for 1 minute.\n18. Then add \u00bc cup finely chopped capsicum (shimla mirch or green bell pepper).\n19. Mix very well.\n20. Stir fry on medium to high flame for 2 minutes.\n21. Reduce the flame and then add 2 tablespoons tomato ketchup, 1 tablespoon soy sauce and \u2028\u00bd tablespoon red chili sauce (or sweet red chili sauce or sriracha sauce).\n22. Mix very well.\n23. Add 2 cups of water. For a thick gravy or sauce you can add less water.\n24. Mix very well and simmer on a medium to high flame.\n25.\u00a0let the water come to a boil.\n26. Reduce the flame. Then add the corn starch paste. Stir the paste and then add as the corn starch settles down at the bottom of the bowl.\n27. As soon as you add corn starch paste mix very well.

Cauliflower manchurian is a popular Indo Chinese recipe of pan fried cauliflower florets coated with a spicy sauce. This delicious starter snack is easy to prepare and taste damn good.\nThis crispy gobi manchurian is a dry version and makes for an excellent starter\/side dish or snack. I have already posted a Vegan Gobi manchurian with sauce . when I make veg fried rice or simple fried rice without any veggies, I prepare the gobi manchurian with sauce or as we say in India, with gravy.\nGet My Secrets to Great Indian Food\nSign up for my FREE Beginners Guide to Delicious Indian Cooking\nFairly easy to prepare, this delicious dry gobi manchurian recipe is not spicy like the restaurant or street versions. If you want, you can add more of the ginger, garlic and green chilies and increase the spice and heat in the dish.\nThe gobi manchurian dry that we get outside has a good amount of red color added to the batter. Here, no colors are added. To get an orangish color, you can increase the amount of Kashmiri red chili powder or deghi mirch. This will also add some heat and a smoky flavor.\nTo cut down the fat, I have not deep fried the gobi florets . it does reduce the crispness, though. But as a healthier option, I have pan fried the gobi florets. If you prefer, you can deep fry the batter coated cauliflower florets.\nUsually at home, I serve the gobi manchurian with roti. As thats how we prefer it. You can serve them plain with a spicy sauce like schezwan sauce or even red chili garlic chutney. Even tomato sauce goes well. You can also wrap the cauliflower manchurian in a thin roti and top with some shredded carrots, cabbage and onions along with some sauce.\nYou can also serve this gobi manchurian \u00a0as a snack or as a side dish with\u00a0veg fried rice or\u00a0hakka noodles\u00a0or\u00a0noodles\u00a0or burnt garlic fried rice\u00a0or 5 spice rice.\nHow to make gobi manchurian\nPreparation\n1.\u00a0firstly chop or break the gobi\/cauliflower in medium size florets. Heat water with salt and boil it. Rinse the cauliflower florets and add them to the hot water. Cover and let the cauliflower florets get blanched in the water for 15-20 minutes. Later drain and keep aside.\n2.\u00a0in a bowl mix together the dry ingredients for making the batter.\n3.\u00a0add water and whisk to make a smooth batter without any lumps.\n4. Dip each cauliflower floret in the batter.\n5. Fry the batter coated cauliflower florets in hot oil. I have pan fried and added about 6 tbsp oil. Later I have not added any oil while stir-frying the spring onions etc. You can also deep fry or shallow fry. I have fried in batches of three. So depending on the size of your pan, you can fry at once or in batches. The frying does take some time, so patience is the key.\n6. When one side gets cooked and crisp, turn over each florets and pan fry the uncooked sides. Flip for a couple of times more, so that the florets are evenly fried and light golden.\n7. Drain the fried cauliflower florets on a kitchen paper towel.\nMaking\u00a0gobi manchurian dry\n8. No need to add any oil again. In the same pan, add chopped ginger, garlic and green chilies. Saute for half a minute.\n9. Then add the chopped spring onions & capsicum\/green bell pepper. Increase the flame and stir fry till the capsicum is half cooked or almost cooked.\n10. Add soy sauce, tomato sauce, black pepper and salt. Stir.\n11. Add the pan-fried cauliflower florets.\n12. Stir fry for two to three minutes ensuring the spiced sauce coats the cauliflower florets well. Lastly, add vinegar and stir well. Switch off the fire. Mix in the chopped spring onions greens or garnish with them while serving cauliflower manchurian.\nServe dry gobi manchurian As a snack or as a side dish with veg fried rice or schezwan\u00a0fried rice or cabbage fried rice\u00a0or mushroom\u00a0noodles.\nFew more snacks recipes for you!\nCheese balls\nDry veg manchurian\nWhite sauce pasta\nBaby corn manchurian\nMushroom manchurian\nSTEP BY STEP PHOTOS ABOVE Many of my recipes have detailed step by step photos and useful tips to help you make it easily and perfectly.\nPIN\nPRINT\nGobi Manchurian\n4.77 from 17 votes\nThis cauliflower manchurian dry is a popular indo Chinese recipe of pan fried cauliflower florets coated with a spicy sauce.\nAuthor: Dassana Amit\nPrep Time: 40\nmins\nCook Time: 20\nmins\nTotal Time: 1\nhr\nCourse: snacks\nCuisine: indo chinese\nDiet: vegetarian\nServings (change the number to scale): 4\nto 5\n(1 CUP = 250 ML)\nIngredients\nfor pan frying gobi florets\n1\nmedium cauliflower\n1\ncup\nall purpose flour\n4\ntablespoon\ncorn starch\n\u00bc\nteaspoon\nblack pepper powder\n\u00bc to \u00bd\nteaspoon\nkashmiri red chilli powder\nor deghi mirch (add about 1 teaspoon to get a good color. but this will also increase the heat a bit)\n1\nteaspoon\nsoy sauce\n1\ncup\n+ 1 tablespoon water\nor as required\n5 to 6\ntablespoon\noil for pan frying\nother ingredients\n\u00be\ncup\nchopped spring onion\n(scallion whites) - reserve the greens for garnish\n\u00bd\ncup\nfinely chopped capsicum\n(green bell pepper)\n1.5\ninch\nginger,\nfinely chopped or 3 teaspoon finely chopped ginger\n8 to 10\nmedium garlic,\nfinely chopped or 3 teaspoon finely chopped garlic\n2\ngreen chilies,\nfinely chopped or 1 teaspoon finely chopped green chilies\n\u00bd\ntablespoon\nfinely chopped celery\n(optional)\n1.5\ntablespoon\nlight soy sauce or \u00bd to 1 tablespoon soy sauce\nyou can also add as per your taste\n1\ntablespoon\ntomato sauce\nor add as required\n1\nteaspoon\nrice vinegar\nor \u00bd teaspoon white vinegar or apple cider vinegar\n\u00bc to \u00bd\nteaspoon\nblack pepper powder\nsalt as required\nInstructions\npreparing cauliflower florets\nFirstly chop or break the gobi\/cauliflower in medium size florets.\nHeat water with salt and boil it.

chivda\nbombay mixture namkeen | bombay spicy nut mix | mumbai mixture chivda\nBy\nHebbars Kitchen\n-\nMarch 19, 2020\nthis post is also available in \u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940 (Hindi)\nbombay mixture namkeen | bombay spicy nut mix | mumbai mixture chivda with detailed photo and video recipe. an interesting and tasty snack recipe made with a mixture of deep-fried snacks like, sev, cashews and peanuts. it is typically served as munching evening snack with a cup of tea or coffee, but can also be used as topping to upma or poha breakfast recipes. generally, these kinds of mixtures or chivdas are typically bought from stores rather than making at home, but it is extremely simple to make at home.\nbombay mixture namkeen recipe | bombay spicy nut mix | mumbai mixture chivda with step by step photo and video recipe. chivda or mixture recipes are extremely common across india and are made and served for different reasons. each region and state of india has its own unique and tasty spice mixture or chivda recipe. one such easy and simple chivda namkeen recipe from the western india is the bombay mixture namkeen recipe known for its medium spice level.\nas i explained earlier, there is a myth about chivda or namkeen recipes with many aspirant cooks. many think it is one of the complicated recipes and more importantly, it requires complicated and sophisticated devices to make such thin fried noodles (sev). well in this recipe post i have shown how to use easily available kitchen equipment and prepare a store like namkeen. basically the main equipment you would require is the chakli maker machine with fine mould for thin noodles. in this recipe, i have not shown how to make spicy boondi \u2018s as it is not required for this version of mumbai mixture. but if you wish to add you can still make it with the skimmer , by pouring spiced besan mixer on top of it.\nanyway, i would like to add some tips, suggestions and variations to a perfect bombay mixture namkeen recipe . firstly, the mumbai mixture chivda uses fine sev and hence i would recommend to find and use a small holed mould. moreover, while you start dropping these to hot oil, be careful not overlap it too much. otherwise, it may not get cooked evenly. in addition, i would recommend to deep fry these in small batches. secondly, the use of masoor dal is very important for this recipe. you may have not seen this in any other recipe, but adding these makes it unique for this recipe. lastly, store these in an airtight container for long shelf life. you may want to preserve it in a warm and dry place.\nfinally, i request you to check my other snacks recipes collection with this post of bombay mixture namkeen recipe . it mainly includes recipe variations like aloo ke kabab , beetroot vadai , aloo paneer tikki , dal dhokla , corn vada , gulgula , suji snacks , batata vada , cabbage vada , vegetable nuggets . further to these i would also like to

(Hindi)\nhot and sour soup recipe | hot n sour soup | hot sour soup recipe with detailed photo and video recipe. an easy and simple soup recipe known for its spice and sourness taste. it is fast food or a street food recipe served as appetizer or starter just before an indo chinese or north indian meal. generally, it is made with diced vegetables and indo chinese sauces and a fried noodles topping, but can also be made with a choice of meat.\nhot and sour soup recipe | hot n sour soup | hot sour soup recipe with step by step photo and video recipe. indo chinese is known for its spicy and flavoured taste which is catered for indian taste buds. it is a mixture of full of flavours with bitterness, spice, sour and savoury in it. it does offer the same taste in its soup variations too and hot and sour soup recipe is one such simple and quick filling recipe.\ni am not a huge fan of full course meal offered by indo chinese recipes. i typically avoid it and prefer something north indian or south indian. yet, whenever we plan for outdoor dining, it always begins with some indo chinese starters or soup as an appetizer. my personal favourite is, to begin with, tomato soup recipe or with hot and sour soup recipe . the best part of this soup is the sourness in its taste which activates the taste buds. most of the soup offers you either spice or some sort of savoury. but in hot sour soup , it is a combination of spice and sourness and thus makes it an ideal meal starter.\nfurthermore, before wrapping the recipe, some tips, suggestions and variations to hot sour soup recipe . firstly, the consistency is key for this recipe. the consistency should be thicker than water, but still not thick. hence be careful with your corn starch addition step. secondly, the recipe should be served warm and it would not taste good when rested. hence plan your soup accordingly and ideally served just before the meal. lastly, when adding veggies to it, ensure to either slice it thinly or dice it in a small shape. this is due to the fact that we do not boil or cook the vegetables and just saute it at high temperature.\nfinally, i request you to check my other soup recipes collection with this post of hot and sour soup recipe . it mainly includes recipes variations like vegetable soup , lemon coriander soup , bonda soup , sweet corn soup , beetroot soup , lemon rasam , punarpuli

cauliflower 65 | how to make crispy gobi fry 65\nBy\nHebbars Kitchen\n-\nSeptember 19, 2019\nthis post is also available in \u0c95\u0ca8\u0ccd\u0ca8\u0ca1 (Kannada)\ngobi 65 recipe | cauliflower 65 | how to make crispy gobi fry 65 with detailed photo and video recipe. an interesting crispy tea time snack recipe made with cauliflower florets and spices. it is interesting because of the name it carries and it is assumed that it got its name from a military canteen. it is an ideal party starter or appetizer with a lip-smacking taste and flavour promised in each gobi florets.\ngobi 65 recipe | cauliflower 65 | how to make crispy gobi fry 65 with step by step photo and video recipe. gobi or cauliflower is a versatile vegetable and is used for different types of indian cuisine. the most common recipe derived from gobi is the sabzi or curry made on day to day basis. yet there are certain snack recipes made from it, and gobi 65 is one such unique and interesting snack recipe full of flavour.\nas i mentioned previously, there is an interesting history about the name for this recipe. apparently the recipe was first started by a military canteen in tamilnadu. in the menu list, it was the 65th item and hence the name was derived as gobi 65 recipe . well that is one of the popular story floating around, but then there are other stories too. i personally like the way it is made and served. it has the crisp texture due to deep fry. at the same time, it is tossed with a spicy yogurt or curd sauce which would lower the temperature but adds a hint of moist to the snack. while tossing with the sauce is not a mandatory, but it helps add desi taste to it.\nanyway, some of the critical and important tips, suggestions and variations for a perfect crispy gobi 65 recipe . firstly, i would heavily recommend using a fresh and tender cauliflower for this recipe. stale cauliflower may turn the gobi florets soggy and may not hold the crisp shape. secondly, i have used cornflour and rice flour to get the necessary crisp level, but this can be achieved with just rice flour too. but use it only when you do not have corn flour . lastly, due to the nature of the recipe, it has to be served immediately once it is tossed with yoghurt sauce. alternatively you can deep fry and keep it ready and toss it with the sauce when you are about to serve it.\nfinally, i would like

paneer with chilli sauce makes it lethal. moreover, in this recipe, i have deep-fried the paneer cubes with a spiced batter, before tossing it with chilli sauce. this makes it more crispy, tasty and flavoured but some prefer adding paneer cubes as it is without deep frying .\nfurthermore, some easy and important tips, suggestions and variations for a perfect chilli paneer recipe . firstly, my preferred preference is to make chilli sauce as hot and sweet, and hence i use tomato sauce with chilli sauce. yet it can be made without any sweetness with just chilli sauce in it. secondly, the paneer has to be moist and tender for the best result. hence i would recommend using homemade paneer cubes or fresh paneer from the store. lastly, the flavour of chilli sauce can be increased or decreased with the use of green chillies in it. hence add it as per your preference.\nfinally, i request you to visit my other indian street food recipes collection with this post of chilli paneer

recipe | leftover rice cutlets | chawal ke cutlet | chawal ki tikki\nBy\nHebbars Kitchen\n-\nJuly 19, 2019\nthis post is also available in \u0c95\u0ca8\u0ccd\u0ca8\u0ca1 (Kannada)\nrice cutlet recipe | leftover rice cutlets | chawal ke cutlet | chawal ki tikki with detailed photo and video recipe. an interesting and a filling cutlet recipe made with leftover rice and veggies. it is indeed an excellent way to finish leftover rice where it transforms a bowl of boring rice to something exciting snack. it can be easily served as it is without any extra condiments, but taste when served with a spicy green chutney or even mayo sauce.\nrice cutlet recipe | leftover rice cutlets | chawal ke cutlet | chawal ki tikki with step by step photo and video recipe. cutlet recipes are generally made with mixed veggies or with any choice meat. it is either served as a street food snack by itself or as filler in sandwich or burger recipe. one such popular cutlet which had arrived lately in the market is the rice cutlet recipe made with leftover rice and choice of veggies.\nas i mentioned earlier the recipe is very similar to my other previous cutlet recipes. the recipe is made with almost the same ingredients like the mixed veggies, spice mix and also the cooking method. yet the rice cutlet recipe is unique by its own way. basically adding the cooked and mashed rice with veggies makes it very unique. additionally, the combination of rice and vegetables makes it filling and hence the dish is not just limited as a snack. i personally make these and stuff it up with either sandwich or burger, which eventually served for lunch or dinner. to be honest, i would not recommend it as an evening snack, but it all depends upon your individual appetite.\nfurthermore, i would like to highlight some tips, suggestions and variations for a perfect rice cutlet recipe . firstly, the cooked rice plays a critical role in this recipe. it has to be cooked well and eventually, it has to be mashed well. if you feel the cooked rice is still hard, boil or microwave it for a few minutes. secondly, the potatoes have to be mashed properly with less moisture in it. once it is pressure-cooked, remove it from boiling water so that it does not absorb excess water. lastly, these tikki or cutlet can be shaped to any desired shape. i have shaped it to diamond, but these can be shaped to round or any particular shape.\nfinally, i request you to check my other related snacks recipes collection with this post of rice cutlet recipe . it mainly includes recipes like, susla , rice pakora , chekkalu
