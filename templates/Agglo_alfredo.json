I make it with shrimp for him for his birthday every year. GREAT for company because it is so easy and yet taste wonderful! I cook this in the microwave, but I'm sure you could do it on the stove too. Times are what work in my microwave. Please use your own good judgment on times to use in your microwave. (In my quest to eat healthier, I now make it with light butter, light cream and reduced fat Parmesan cheese. It still tastes wonderful, but there isn't any guilt!) PLEASE NOTE! This is an &quot;authentic&quot; Alfredo sauce recipe! Real Alfredo sauce *only* contains butter, cream, Parmesan cheese and pepper. It will be thin and there is no garlic in it! If you want a thicker sauce or one with garlic like modern restaurants serve, please look elsewhere!

Add cream and warm on high for approximately 1 minute. Add Parmesan cheese and warm until cheese melts. Add salt and pepper to taste. (If serving with shrimp, you might not need much salt.). Pour over 4 servings of warm noodles (I use angel hair) and toss to coat. Serve immediately. Notes: I serve it with cubed, grilled or broiled chicken breast mixed in with the noodles or shrimp. Add a green salad and you have a complete meal. I have used margarine and canned Parmesan cheese and it worked fine.

Baked Kidney Beans with Alfredo Sauce features tortillas packed with a fabulously peppy stuffing of kidney beans, chunky veggies and sauces, and laced with creamy Alfredo Sauce. Alfredo Sauce seems similar to continental white sauce, but it has a different texture and even flavour because of the inclusion of cheese. The packed tortillas are placed in a bed of Alfredo Sauce, topped with more sauce and cheese, and baked till it all fuses together into one irresistible treat! Enjoy it right off the oven for the best flavour and texture.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook the pasta according to the package directions. Drain and set aside. Slice the chicken into thin strips and season with salt and pepper. Heat the butter and oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken strips and cook until deep golden brown on both sides and done in the middle.

Position an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Cook the pasta to al dente according to the package directions. (Reserve some pasta water to add back in case the dish needs moisture.) Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat and add the garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, until very fragrant but not browned, about 1 minute. Add the cream and Parmesan and cook, stirring frequently until the mixture begins to boil, about 5 minutes. Add the chicken and cooked pasta and carefully toss to completely coat, then continue to cook until the mixture is smooth and thick, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and add the remaining 6 tablespoons butter. Carefully stir until the butter is completely melted and the sauce is glossy and creamy; remove from the heat.\\xa0 Alternating 1 slice of tomato and 1 slice of mozzarella, shingle around the outer edge of the skillet creating a ring that covers the pasta. Repeat with the remaining tomato and mozzarella forming smaller concentric rings until the pasta is completely covered. Drizzle with the olive oil, sprinkle with some salt and bake until the mozzarella is beginning to melt but the slices still hold their shape and are still white, about 20 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes, then top with the basil and serve. Copyright 2018 Television Food Network, G.P. All rights reserved. My Private Notes Add a Note WATCH Watch how to make this recipe.

Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo Getting reviews... Classic and easy to make, this version of Alfredo doesn't use flour to thicken the sauce. Instead, it relies on a slight simmer and a heavy dose of cheese. Save Recipe Level: Easy Total: 25 min Active: 25 min Yield: 4 servings Share This Recipe Pinterest Facebook Twitter Email Level: Easy Total: 25 min Active: 25 min Yield: 4 servings Ingredients Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper 12 ounces fettuccine Olive oil, for tossing 12 ounces boneless, skinless chicken breast (about 2)\\xa0 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter 2 cups heavy cream 2 pinches freshly grated nutmeg 1 1\/2 cups freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano\\xa0 Directions Bring a large pot of water to a boil, and salt generously. Add the pasta and cook according to package directions until al dente, tender but still slightly firm. Strain, and toss with a splash of oil. Meanwhile, slice the chicken into 1\/4-inch-thick strips, and lay them on a plate or a sheet of waxed paper. Season with salt and pepper. Heat a large skillet over medium heat, and add 2 tablespoons of the butter. When the butter melts, raise the heat to medium-high and add the chicken in 1 layer. Cook, without moving the pieces, until the underside has browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip the pieces, and cook until browned and fully cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer the chicken to a medium bowl. Reduce the heat to medium, and add the remaining 6 tablespoons butter. Scrape the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon to release any browned bits. When the butter has mostly melted, whisk in the cream and nutmeg and bring to a simmer, then cook for 2 minutes. Lower the heat to keep the sauce just warm. Whisk the Parmigiano-Reggiano into the sauce. Add the chicken and cooked pasta, and toss well. Season with salt and pepper. Serve hot in heated bowls. Cook\u2019s Note Don't worry if it seems like there is too much sauce. As soon as everything is tossed together, the sauce will start to cling to the pasta and thicken before your eyes!

For the homemade fettuccine: Combine the flour and salt in a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. Add the eggs and yolks and mix on medium speed. Turn the mixer off and scrape down the sides of the bowl, pushing the flour towards the center. Continue to mix on medium speed, repeating these steps until the dough comes together into a ball. If the dough sticks to the sides of the bowl, add flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, until it forms a cohesive ball. Knead the dough on medium-high for 3 to 4 minutes. When the dough is smooth, bright yellow in color and bounces back when pressed, transfer it to a lightly floured work surface. Knead by hand a few more times and then form into a ball. The dough should feel moist but not sticky; knead in more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, as necessary. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours but no more than 4 hours. Fit the stand mixer with the pasta roller attachment and set to the widest setting (No. 1). Position the stand mixer with 2 to 3 feet of counter space to the left. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and divide into three portions. Work with one piece of dough at time, keeping the rest under plastic wrap so it doesn't dry out. With your fingers, press a portion of the dough into a roughly 5-by-2 1\/2-inch rectangle. Dust lightly with flour on both sides. Turn the mixer onto low speed and feed the dough through the roller with the 2 1\/2-inch parallel to the roller. Next, fold the two ends of the dough into the center so they just meet and then fold one half over the other so the dough closes like a book; this is called laminating the dough. Use your fingers to seal the two edges together, then once again shape the dough into a 5-by-2 1\/2-inch rectangle. Dust the dough with flour and feed it through the roller a second time. Repeat by laminating the dough one more time and feeding it through the roller. Dust with flour and feed through the roller three more times, dust with more flour as needed. Adjust the roller to setting No. 3 and feed the dough through the roller twice. Adjust to setting No. 5 and feed the dough through two more times. At this point the dough will be over a foot long. Use your right hand to feed the dough through the roller and your left hand to catch the dough. Always be very gentle with the dough to prevent tearing. Be sure to feed the dough through the machine so that it does not fold onto itself. You can make small adjustments to how the dough is entering the roller by gently guiding it to the left or right. If the dough is too long to handle, simply cut it in half and work with a smaller portion. Finally, adjust the roller to setting No. 7 and feed the dough through another two times. After the dough has gone through the roller for the last time, dust it all over with flour and then fold it over itself and hold under a piece of plastic wrap. Repeat these steps with the remaining two pieces of dough. Replace the roller attachment with the fettucine cutter attachment. Dust a baking sheet with flour. Cut the rolled dough into 12-inch pieces and feed through the fettucine cutter on low speed. Twist the fettucine into a nest and place on the prepared baking sheet. Cover with plastic wrap while you cut the remaining dough. Lightly dust the tops of the fettucine nests with flour, cover with slightly dampened paper towel and then with plastic wrap. Hold at room temperature for no more than an hour or the pasta will dry out. (Makes 1 pound pasta dough.) For the chicken and broccoli alfredo: Place a baking sheet in the oven and preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Mix the broccoli florets with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, 1 teaspoon of the lemon zest, and salt and pepper to taste. Add the broccoli to the preheated baking sheet and roast until the lightly charred and tender, 18 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Season with salt so that the water tastes like the ocean. Heat a 12-inch, high-sided pan over medium heat. Add the butter and the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Sprinkle the chicken breasts with salt and pepper. When the butter is melted, add the chicken and cook until browned and cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes per side. If the chicken has browned on both sides but isn't cooked through yet, remove to a baking sheet and finish in the oven. Let cool and then cut into 1\/2-inch pieces. To the same pan, add the minced garlic; cook until fragrant, 1 minute. Add the flour and stir to combine, scraping up the dark bits from the bottom of the pan. Whisk in 1 cup of the half-and-half, making sure the flour is completely combined, without any lumps. Whisk in the remaining 3 cups half-and-half, bring to a boil and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. When the mixture has thickened around the edges, but before your whisk leaves a trail behind it, add the remaining 1 teaspoon lemon zest and the Asiago and Parmesan, and whisk to combine. Turn the heat to low and season with salt and pepper. The sauce should have the consistency of a thick soup. If the sauce thickens too much, add a little of the pasta water to thin it out. Add the chicken and broccoli to the cheese sauce and hold over low heat. Meanwhile, cook to the pasta: Separate the strands of pasta on the baking sheet and add them to the boiling water. Cook for 30 seconds, or until the pasta floats to the top. Drain and add to the cheese sauce. Add the lemon juice and toss to combine. Garnish with parsley and serve immediately.

Put the cauliflower, broth, and 1 cup water in a small pot; bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Adjust the heat to maintain a simmer and cook until the cauliflower is very soft, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool 5 minutes. Carefully puree cauliflower and all the liquid in a blender until very smooth; set aside. 2.

Remove from the heat and toss in the butter, chopped parsley and lemon zest. (If the sauce seems thick, adjust the consistency with the remaining pasta water).

Ready and on the table in less than 20 minutes! Crispy golden seared chicken is mixed through a super creamy garlic parmesan Alfredo sauce! Our favourite Chicken Alfredo recipe with the pasta cooked right in is perfect comfort food at its finest. CHICKEN ALFREDO Move over store-bought Alfredo sauces and even restaurant Alfredo. This chicken Alfredo recipe has the best homemade Alfredo sauce! SO MUCH FLAVOUR! This recipe is for those emergency dinner moments \u2014 a\\xa0 throw-it-all-in-a-pot-recipe you can do in minutes! Just a simple pot and humble stove top needed. HOW TO MAKE CHICKEN ALFREDO Sear chicken thighs (or breasts) first to enjoy the crispy golden texture through the creamy pasta, then remove them to ensure a juicy chicken pieces. You\u2019re more than welcome to dice the chicken first, sear, then leave in the pot to continue cooking with the rest of the ingredients on from Step 2 in the recipe box (at the end of this post). TIPS FOR ONE POT ALFREDO There are three main steps to this recipe. CHICKEN \u2192 ALFREDO SAUCE \u2192 PASTA. The sauce I use includes wine. I love wine in this but you can leave it out all together if you wish. If using wine, please use a good quality dry white wine. I use a $20 bottle of Pinot Grigio in most of my recipes on this site, but a good Sav Blanc or Chardonnay will suit the favours in this creamy sauce. You can substitute the heavy cream (or thickened cream) with half and half or a reduced fat cooking cream to reduce the calories. You can also use evaporated milk depending on your dietary requirements. Using freshly grated parmesan cheese enhances the flavour and ensures the cheese melts through the sauce. Please don\u2019t use powdered parmesan. Remove the pot off of the stove when the pasta is just cooked al dente (firm to the bite). The sauce begins to evaporate quickly into the hot pasta while it\u2019s resting or waiting to be served. Chicken Alfredo has never been easier! ALFREDO SAUCE The sauce in this recipe naturally thickens as the starch from the pasta is released into the sauce while cooking. If the sauce is too thick for your liking, add extra cream (or evaporated milk) in 1\/4 cup increments until smooth and silky. \u2193\u2193\u2193 LIKE SO\\xa0\u2193\u2193\u2193 MORE PASTA RECIPES Skinny One Pot Chicken Bacon Fettuccine Alfredo Tuscan Chicken Mac And Cheese (One Pot, Stove Top) Avocado Alfredo Zoodles With Chicken + Sun Dried Tomatoes \\xa0(LOW CARB) CREAMY CHICKEN ALFREDO RECIPE One Pot Creamy Garlic Parmesan Chicken Alfredo Creamy Garlic Parmesan Chicken Alfredo is all cooked in ONE POT!

Reply Rick Irwin says March 20, 2020 at I admit I\u2019m not an fan of Alfredo. Since my family likes it I tried this recipe. WOW. It was super. I made the recipe as stated, the only exception was I doubled it as we all enjoy leftovers. I also went ahead and addded all the whipping cream at step 4. It cooked up nice with wonderful flavor. I will definitely will be making this again! Reply Irene says March 18, 2020 at Can i use tortellini with cheese in it to make this? Will it make a difference? Have made it with penne and loved it but wanted to try it with this type pasta Reply Alice says March 8, 2020 at This one is a keeper! I have tried other sauces that didn\u2019t come out right. This was perfect! Thank you! Reply Essie Farmer says March 3, 2020 at OMG!!! Absolutely amazing!!!! Very simple but soo much flavor!!! When my son goes back for seconds, it\u2019s always a hit!!! Will be making again!! Thanks. Reply Pam says January 15, 2020 at Easy perfection!Thank you so much for this recipe,I am always looking for easy chicken and pasta dishes and this one right here is a winner. I also steamed some broccoli and added to the pot after the cheese and cream\u2026yummy ? Reply Trista says February 13, 2019 at Seriously bookmarking this forever ..so delicious! Reply Katherine says January 29, 2019 at I use fat free half and half to lighten it up. Is that the reason my sauce always breaks? It still tastes delicious, but doesn\u2019t look as good. Love your recipes!! Reply DJ Simpson says January 7, 2019 at The easiest and flavorful recipe I have ever made. Simple with a punch of flavors I added some broccoli for texture and to put greens in our life .

Tastes great but there is so much extra sauce. Its not thick and is like soup \ud83d\ude41 lol what did i do wrong? Followed recipe exactly and with all your ingrediants.. wait no i didnt\u2026 i didnt have chicken stock i used water and a chicken cube.. shouldnt have made a difference though?? \ud83d\ude41 Reply Sam says March 4, 2020 at did you cook the pasta in the sauce? the starch will help thicken the sauce, as well as the sauce naturally reducing as you simmer it. Mine on the other hand was too thick and rich! Maybe we could mix ours together Reply Michel says December 10, 2018 at Hi! I wanted to make this for a Christmas party. I need to at least double it. Should I just double all ingredients? I know that\u2019s whats logical, but with some recipes that\u2019s not the case. Also, should I save sauce to add once I get to the party so it isn\u2019t dry? Sorry, I just want it to be yummy for the party.(: thank you Reply Karina says December 17, 2018 at Hello Michel! This is a great idea for a party. Yes, with this you will double all the ingredients. It will work out the best. It would be a great idea to take sauce to the party. That will help keep it moist. Thanks for the comment and for following along with me!! Reply Rachel says November 20, 2018 at I just made this recipe tonight and it is hands down the best home made Alfredo sauce I\u2019ve ever made! I\u2019ve used a few different recipes in the past and they came out okay, the texture was always off and they were always missing something. I took out the mushrooms as both myself and my boyfriend don\u2019t love them. I was wanting to use up the rest of our spinach and broccoli before they went bad so I saut\u00e9ed the spinach with the onions and garlic and added the cut up broccoli when I added the pasta and it came out cooked perfectly. I used about 1\/2 cup light cream and 3\/4 cup heavy cream bc I was also wanting to use it up from my fridge before they spoiled. This was seriously delicious, it tasted just like a great Italian restaurants Alfredo sauce and thats what I\u2019ve been looking for all this time! This will definitely be a keeper, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll have look for another Alfredo recipe ! Reply Anjel says November 8, 2018 at Do you have any suggestions for warming up this recipe? I like to have the option for leftovers, but the sauce is usually an issue. Recipe looks delish Reply Karina says November 11, 2018 at I would recommend baking it in the oven. You are welcome to leave some sauce out and when preparing it for reheating adding the extra sauce on top so it does not become dry. Reply Nicole says November 5, 2018 at Just made this for dinner tonight and would definitely make it again. Great recipe. I did not include the wine and I added sun dried tomatoes. Tasted great. Reply Nicole says August 27, 2018 at Hello, Im a little nervous to use Pinot Grigio- Ive used it in the past and the sweetness of the wine overpowers the recipe. Reply Marion says August 25, 2018 at Great recipe! I just made it, and it tastes delicious! Thanks for sharing ??? Reply Ivory says April 6, 2018 at This looks amazingly delicious. No surprise, because all you post is mouthwatering. Thanks for sharing. Reply Crystal says April 4, 2018 at I have made this twice, first time like it says and the second time I changed the chicken to shrimp and the chicken broth to seafood broth. My children told me it was better than olive garden. Reply Karina says April 6, 2018 at WOW!! That is great to hear! Thank you so much for letting me know! I am so glad it was so good for all of you! Thanks for following along with me! Reply Terri says March 19, 2018 at Could you freeze this recipe? If so, would you freeze before or after baking it ? Reply Karina says March 19, 2018 at You are welcome to freeze it but sometimes it does not heat up well the best because the sauces will separate. I would recommend baking it first then freezing though. Hope that helps and it tastes great! Thanks so much for following along with me! Reply Selma says March 19, 2018 at Thank you so much for your GREAT recipes! They turn out as you say they will which is a beautiful thing\u2026 so tired of those \u201cI followed this as written and it did not work!\u201d I will make this for dinner tonight! Your Cinnamon Roll recipe was PERFECT! I gave some to my friend as it is her favorite and it was her birthday. THANK YOU for an EXCELLENT Blog! Reply Sandy says March 13, 2018 at I have a new problem involving dairy items. My husband has become lactose intolerant. The cheesey cream base sauces I love. Even the garlic herb butter sauces I just don\u2019t know how to make the new substitutions without losing the flavor. Please Help me\u2026. Reply Karina says March 14, 2018 at Hmmm!! That is a tricky one! I am not sure what all to substitute for the both of you. You can still use dairy free items and add seasoning to enhance the sauce. Would that help?! Reply Talia says March 13, 2018 at I just made this for lunch and holy crap it\u2019s good! My kids licked their plates clean. THANK YOU for your tips. I\u2019m not confident in the kitchen and even though I\u2019m a 40 year old woman I normally stick to steak and potatoes. This was a stretch! And an easy one. I love that you help us through each of your recipes Karina. It\u2019s like you were cooking right here with me. Off to make your brownies now! Thank you for bringing joy back into cooking! Reply Karina says March 13, 2018 at Talia you\u2019ve made my day! I\u2019m so happy to read this! Thank you for sharing your feedback. I\u2019m so happy you all enjoyed it! Kids kicking plates clean is a good sign ? Reply Janet says March 13, 2018 at What do you consider one serving for the chicken Parmesan? Thank you. Reply Karina says March 14, 2018 at I like to use myfitnesspal.com or skinnytaste.com for portion and nutrition ingredients. That would give you an accurate amount of portion and serving that you are looking for. Hope that helps you! Thanks so much for following along with me! Reply Robyn says March 13, 2018 at If you omit the wine should you use broth instead? And if you do, should you adjust the amount of broth added later? Reply Karina says March 14, 2018 at Yes, you will want to add broth or another sauce to get the juices in. It will be great! I am excited to hear how it turns out! Thanks so much for following along with me!

We\u2019ve got loads of flavour packed into this simple, hearty dish. From the number of pasta bakes and\\xa0 other pasta recipes on our site, I think you can guess how much we love pasta. I often make tomato-based pasta dishes, but today I felt like sharing a rich and creamy pasta bake . This one is definitely rich! Pasta smothered in a creamy sauce with a little garlic and a hint of white wine (optional) with parmesan, cheddar AND mozzarella! Not forgetting the shredded chicken (a great way to use up leftover chicken) and lots of lovely mushrooms. Just talking about it makes me want to eat it all over again. So what exactly is alfredo sauce? It\u2019s a very simple white sauce, usually made with butter , cream and parmesan . It\u2019s most commonly seen with the Italian classic Fettucine alfredo. I\u2019m going with a similar flavour profile here, but with some added extras (such as garlic and more cheese!) to make it even more delicious. What do we need to make this bake? This recipe uses leftover cooked chicken from your Roast Chicken Dinner. More recipes using cooked leftover chicken: Tuscan Chicken Soup Creamy Chicken and Potato Bake Roast Chicken & Creamy Garlic Mushroom Burger Chicken ala King Garlic Chicken Pasta with Kale Here are the simple steps: Full ingredient quantities and instructions are in the recipe card below. Soften a chopped onion in a large frying pan with a little oil. Then add in mushrooms, salt, pepper and garlic, and cook for a few minutes, until the mushrooms are tender. Next in goes the white wine that we bubble for a few minutes before adding in chicken stock, cream, shredded chicken and parmesan. Heat through, while stirring, until the parmesan melts , then add cooked drained pasta and stir again. Transfer to a large baking dish and sprinkle on parmesan, cheddar and mozzarella. Then bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes until the cheese is golden brown .

Boil a large pan of water and cook the pasta for 1 minute less than recommended on the pack. Drain. Whilst the pasta is cooking, heat the oil on a medium heat, in a large frying pan. Add the onion and cook for 4-5 minutes, stirring occassionally, until the onion softens. Add the mushrooms, salt, pepper and garlic, and cook for a further 3-4 minutes, stirring often, until the mushrooms are tender. Add the white wine, turn up the heat to high and allow the wine to bubble for a few minutes until reduced by half, then turn the heat back down to medium. Add the chicken stock, cream, shredded chicken and half of the parmesan and stir together until the cheese melts. By now the pasta should be cooked. Add the drained pasta to the pan and stir together until the pasta is coated in the creamy sauce. Transfer the contents of the pan to a large baking dish. Sprinkle the remaining parmesan and the cheddar and mozzarella on top, then place in the oven for 20-25 minutes until the cheese is golden brown. Remove from the oven and sprinkle with parsley before serving. Recipe Video Recipe Notes What type of pasta to use: I use Fusilli for this, but you can use any larger-sized pasta you like - such as Spiralli (pasta spirals), Penne (tubes cut on the diagonal), Rigatoni (ribbed pasta tubes, square-cut on the ends) and Farfalle (pasta bows) all work particularly well, with no change in amounts or cooking times. You can also use Ziti - which is similar to Rigatoni, but a little smaller and not ribbed (unless you buy Ziti Rigati - which is ribbed). I was thinking of making this dish a baked alfredo ziti, but ziti pasta is very difficult to find in the UK. Can I make it ahead? Yes! You can make ahead up to the point where you have sprinkled the cheese on, then cool, cover with foil and refrigerate for up to a day. Take out of the fridge for an hour before cooking it, to take the chill off the dish (otherwise you mind find you get a cold spot in the middle when baking it). Keep the foil on and heat in the oven at 190C\/375F for about 10 minutes, then remove the foil and continue to heat for a further 15 minutes, until hot throughout. Note: the dish will be a little less saucy if you make it ahead, as the pasta will absorb more of the liquid. You can a few tablespoons of stock or hot water before heating the pasta to ensure it\u2019s still saucy if you like. Will it freeze? Yes, once cooked: Cool quickly, cover and freeze. Defrost in the refrigerator overnight, then take out of the fridge for an hour before cooking it. Reheat in the oven (covered in foil) at 190C\/375F for about 20-25 minutes until hot throughout. Add a few tablespoons of stock or hot water when reheating the pasta to ensure it\u2019s still saucy.

How To Make Shrimp Alfredo Some Alfredo sauce recipes usually start with a roux, and some are based on butter\/heavy cream.

This recipe is so easy it has only three steps to it: Cook shrimp Add sauce ingredients Thicken With the right quantity of each ingredient, you end up with a beautiful silky creamy pesto sauce perfect for serving over anything, really.

This is the best and most simple recipe for Alfredo sauce that you will find! This is one of my absolute favorite sauces to make. Why? Well its incredibly easy , it\u2019s so versatile, and the three main ingredients are butter, cream, and cheese. How can you go wrong with that ?! While I used this sauce over pasta, you can make pizzas and flatbreads with it, or even use it as a dip. Thank you, Italy , for blessing the culinary world once again. What Is Alfredo Sauce Now, some may argue that Alfredo sauce isn\u2019t really Italian- it\u2019s American. I\u2019ll give you a quick history lesson. This sauce was born in Rome from a man named Alfredo. His sauce was a simple emulsification of butter, Parmesan cheese, and pasta. The version we know and love today includes garlic and cream for a saucier consistency. So I guess we can call this modernized sauce an Italian-American lovechild. Tips for Making the Perfect Alfredo Sauce The sauce will seem thin when you start to mix in the pasta. Don\u2019t worry, just keep tossing. The starches from the pasta will mix into the sauce to give the the perfect consistency. If you use flour or cornstarch to thicken the sauce, it may come out with a gluey consistency once it\u2019s cooled down a bit. You can add a few tsp of Italian seasoning, a pinch of nutmeg or red pepper flakes to add some flare to this sauce. Feel free to get creative with seasoning. You can adjust the ratio of cream to milk in this recipe to suit how rich you\u2019d like it to be. If you try this recipe, please let us know!

Comments Roxann says April 23, 2020 at 9:42 am Jo, I love your recipes and have hooked up many of my friends to your newsletter. Thank you for your many insights. I just wanted to add some insights I\u2019ve learned when we were in Rome at Alredo\u2019s Originale\u201d the way they make it is with butter, and pasta water and parmigiana cheese. I\u2019ve since adapted my recipe to a dash of half & half. I think it cuts down the calories and fat somewhat? But the technique is the same.

Reply yohan says August 26, 2019 at 5:50 pm I tried out your recipe how ever I made a few alterations and added diced (seasoned with thymes chicken spice curry and salt onions ginger and garlic) chicken breast to the Alfredo and it was soo good.

Reply Linda says April 14, 2019 at 5:37 am Made this a few days ago. Loved it. So creamy with tons of flavor. I made extra Alfredo sauce since my hubby prefers saucy pastas. Per your suggestions, I added thinly sliced mushrooms and chicken. Cooked the chicken ahead of time, but the mushrooms cooked right in the Alfredo. This will be my go to Alfredo!

I think you had one for a cheesy chicken casserole using chicken breasts and ranch dressing with macaroni noodles but I cannot find it on your web site. I am getting old and forgetful, so perhaps I saw it somewhere else. It sounded good and I want to try it so if you can help me that would be great. Cooking keeps me sane!

Mattison Taste of Home Creamy, cheesy and comforting: This easy Alfredo sauce is everything you want in a pasta sauce. Every product is independently selected by our editors. If you buy something through our links, we may earn an affiliate commission. Growing up, pasta was my family\u2019s go-to option for easy weeknight dinners, but we never really made anything from scratch. I know an easy Alfredo sauce only takes a few minutes to pull together, but we were more of a box of pasta, jar of sauce and a vegetable side dish kind of family. Then, when I went to culinary school, I learned that a classic Alfredo sauce is nothing more than butter, cream, garlic and Parmesan cheese. You don\u2019t even need the jar of sauce! This Alfredo sauce recipe is simple and creates a creamy, cheesy and super flavorful sauce that comes together in a flash. It almost takes longer to cook the pasta than the sauce. Don\u2019t believe me? Read on to learn how to make Alfredo sauce that\u2019s restaurant-worthy. Tips on Selecting Ingredients Alfredo sauce only contains a handful of ingredients. Everything counts, but the cheese is really the most important factor to making this sauce shine. It\u2019s really important to opt for the highest-quality cheese you can afford. In addition to Parmesan cheese, we added Romano cheese to our recipe. It has a sharp, slightly tangy flavor that adds a level of depth to the sauce. If you just want to use one cheese for simplicity, go ahead and use Parmigiano Reggiano . It\u2019s made in Italy and has a deep, rich, nutty flavor. The cheese labeled \u201cParmesan\u201d isn\u2019t authentic. It might have a similar flavor, but it\u2019s saltier and more acidic than the real deal. No matter what you cheese choose, try to avoid the pre-grated stuff. It doesn\u2019t melt as well, and it may contain anti-clumping agents like plant cellulose. When it comes to cream, stick with heavy cream. We know\u2014it\u2019s not super healthy\u2014but using it is the only way to get Alfredo sauce to thicken naturally. If you swap in half-and-half or milk, you\u2019ll need to add flour or cornstarch to get it thick enough to coat the noodles. Essential Tools You\u2019ll Need via amazon.com Microplane Premium Zester via amazon.com Good Grips Flat Wire Whisk via amazon.com All-Clad Stainless Cookware A multi-clad 12-inch stainless steel fry pan ($130) is our go-to piece of cookware for making pasta sauces. It\u2019s the perfect size for tossing cooked pasta with sauce. If you need, you can also use it to simmer the noodles in the sauce for an extra boost of thickening power. As a bonus, it\u2019s also oven-safe, so you could use it to make baked pasta, too. You\u2019ll also want a flat wire whisk ($8) when making cream sauces. It\u2019s important to stir constantly when adding the cream (and again when adding the cheese) to keep the sauce from breaking. Broken sauce is greasy and unpalatable, but it\u2019s easy to avoid with the right tools. We also recommend using a Microplane ($14) for grating the cheese. You could use any old box grater, but the Microplane creates super fine shreds of cheese that melt seamlessly into the sauce. It\u2019s not just good for cheese, either; use it to zest citrus fruit, grate chocolate or create ground nutmeg. Easy Alfredo Sauce Recipe Taste of Home Ingredients 4 ounces uncooked fettuccine 3 tablespoons butter 1 garlic clove, minced 1 cup heavy whipping cream 1\/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, divided 1\/4 cup grated Romano cheese 1\/8 teaspoon salt Dash ground black pepper Dash ground nutmeg Minced fresh parsley, optional Yield : 2 servings Instructions Step 1: Cook the pasta Cook the fettuccine in seasoned pasta water according to the directions for al dente. When it\u2019s finished, drain but don\u2019t rinse it. You don\u2019t want to remove the starch that coats the outside of the noodles, which helps the sauce stick to the pasta. If the pasta finishes before the sauce, you can toss it with a little bit of olive oil or butter to keep the noodles from sticking together. Step 2: Prepare the sauce In a large saute pan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and cook until it\u2019s fragrant, about 1 minute. Then, slowly add the heavy cream, whisking constantly as you pour until all the cream is incorporated. Bring the mixture up to a gentle simmer and let it cook for 3 to 4 minutes, until it begins to thicken. Editor\u2019s Tip : You can use a saucepan to make the sauce, but we like using a 12-inch fry pan instead. It\u2019s large enough to make the sauce and toss the pasta, so you don\u2019t have to dirty any extra dishes. Step 3: Add the cheese Remove the pan from the heat. Add a handful of the Parmesan and Romano cheese at a time, whisking to incorporate the first handful before adding the next. When all the cheese is added, return the pan to the stovetop. Simmer the sauce gently over low heat for 3 to 4 minutes, until it\u2019s thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Editor\u2019s Tip : Be careful not to boil the sauce at this point. If the heat is too high, the sauce will break and separate. Step 4: Season and serve Season the sauce with salt, black pepper and nutmeg. Add the drained fettuccine to the pan and toss it with the sauce. Portion the pasta into individual bowls and top them with the remaining Parmesan cheese and parsley, if using. How to Thicken Alfredo Sauce If you make the recipe with heavy cream, you shouldn\u2019t need to thicken this Alfredo sauce. Heavy cream contains at least 36% butterfat (as compared to milk\u2019s 3.5% and half-and-half\u2019s 12%). When the cream comes to a simmer, the water content evaporates, leaving a deliciously thick sauce behind. The cheese also adds body when it melts, giving you a naturally thick sauce. Everyone\u2019s preferences are different, so you may prefer a sauce that\u2019s thicker than the recipe below. You have a few options for\\xa0 thickening sauce without using flour or cornstarch: Simmer the pasta in the sauce . The pasta will exude extra starch, adding body to the sauce. Add extra cheese . It will only make the sauce cheesier and more delicious, so go for it! Add an ounce or two of cream cheese . Cream cheese is naturally thick and creamy, and it has the right flavor profile for Alfredo, too. Try an egg yolk . Eggs are great for thickening sauces, but they can scramble when exposed to hot temperatures. You\u2019ll need to temper the yolk first by whisking a cup of the hot sauce into a bowl with the yolk. Then, you can add the tempered yolk mixture to the pot. How to Make a Healthy Alfredo Sauce For a lighter version of Alfredo sauce, try making a roux with one tablespoon each butter and flour. After about two minutes, when the mixture is foamy and bubbling, add your liquid of choice to create a white sauce . You can use one cup of regular milk, half-and-half or a mixture of chicken stock and heavy cream. For a gluten-free version, feel free to use 1-1\/2 teaspoons of cornstarch instead. Create a slurry by mixing it with a tablespoon or two of water. Then, bring the liquid to a simmer and whisk in the slurry. Continue to simmer until the mixture is thickened. Tips for Storage Properly stored, cooked pasta can last three to five days in the refrigerator. That said, pasta isn\u2019t the ideal candidate for leftovers. The noodles will continue to absorb moisture as it sits in the refrigerator, so it will be simultaneously soggy and dry upon reheating. We\u2019ve had the best luck by storing pasta in an airtight container and reheating it with an extra splash of milk. It\u2019s not as good as the first day, but it won\u2019t be dry! Add a teaspoon or two of milk or water to the leftover pasta and cook it over low heat on the stovetop. You can also use the microwave at 50% power. Take care not to heat the pasta too quickly, or the sauce will separate and become greasy. Check out these other ways to reheat pasta . What to Make with Alfredo Sauce Once you\u2019ve mastered this easy Alfredo sauce recipe, use it to make any number of delicious pasta dishes. It\u2019s great with chicken and shrimp (especially when they\u2019re seasoned with Cajun seasoning ). You can also add any number of vegetables, like spinach or kale, broccoli, spring peas, asparagus, mushrooms, zucchini and more.\\xa0Check out these recipes that start with Alfredo sauce . 1 \/ 20 Taste of Home Garden Vegetable Gnocchi When we go meatless, we toss gnocchi (my husband's favorite) with veggies and a dab of pesto.

As the countdown to my move out of state begins and everything seems to be going haywire, I find myself needing a little comfort food. My usual go-to comfort food is pasta with butter, Parmesan, and salt and pepper, but today I decided to go a little further and make this creamy yet lightER Spinach Alfredo Pasta. Goes well with: Homemade Garlic Bread Lighter Spinach Alfredo Pasta What is in Alfredo Sauce? So, to be honest, this is not really an alfredo sauce (I actually wanted to call it \u201cfaux-fredo), but sometimes recipes names are a bit figurative. Real alfredo has like, a stick of butter, a pile of Parmesan, and sometimes (especially if you\u2019re in America) a whoooole lot of heavy cream. I swapped the heavy cream for whole milk, reduced the butter by a lot , and used a little cream cheese to help thicken and stabilize the sauce. So, it\u2019s no longer technically an alfredo, but hey, it\u2019s close enough for me to pretend and feel like I\u2019m eating something super indulgent. Does Spinach Alfredo Pasta Reheat Well? This Lighter Spinach Alfredo Pasta is definitely better when fresh (although I would NEVER turn down leftovers of this), so if you\u2019re cooking for one or two consider cutting the recipe in half. Luckily, this one is super easy to scale up or down. Just change the number of servings in the \u201cservings\u201d box on the recipe card below and the ingredients will auto-adjust. \\xa0 Print Recipe 4.48 from 21 votes Lighter Spinach Alfredo Pasta Creamy and rich, yet never heavy, this Lighter Spinach Alfredo Pasta is an easy and satisfying comfort food.\\xa0 Total Cost: $5.92 recipe \/ $1.48 serving Prep Time: 5 mins Cook Time: 20 mins Total Time: 25 mins Servings: 4 Ingredients 12 oz penne pasta ($0.74) 2 Tbsp butter ($0.27) 2 cloves garlic, minced ($0.16) 2 cups whole milk ($0.62) 6 oz. cream cheese ($1.50) 3\/4 cup grated Parmesan ($1.23) 1\/4 tsp salt ($0.02) Freshly cracked pepper ($0.05) 4 cups baby spinach ($1.33) US Customary - Metric Instructions Bring a large pot of water to a boil to cook the pasta. Once boiling, add the pasta and cook until al dente. Drain the pasta in a colander. While the pasta is cooking, prepare the sauce. Add the butter and minced garlic to a deep skillet or pot and saut\u00e9 over medium heat for 1-2 minutes, or just until the garlic is soft and fragrant, but not brown. Turn the heat down to medium-low. Add the milk to the skillet along with the cream cheese (cut into chunks). Heat the milk and cream cheese while whisking, until the cream cheese has fully melted into the milk. Whisk in the grated Parmesan cheese and continue to whisk as the sauce comes up to a gentle simmer. When it reaches a simmer, the sauce will thicken. Turn the heat down to low to keep the sauce warm. Season the sauce with 1\/4 tsp salt and a generous amount of freshly cracked pepper. Add the fresh spinach to the sauce and stir it in until it has wilted and become limp. Finally, add the cooked and drained pasta to the spinach alfredo sauce and stir to combine. Serve immediately.

Step by Step Photos Start by cooking 12 oz. penne pasta according to the package directions (boil a large pot of water, add the pasta, and continue to boil until al dente). While the pasta is cooking, start the \u201calfredo\u201d sauce. Mince two cloves of garlic and add them to a deep skillet or pot with 2 Tbsp butter. Saut\u00e9 over medium heat for 1-2 minutes, or just until the garlic is soft and fragrant, but not brown. Add 2 cups of whole milk to the skillet and turn the heat down to medium-low. Also add 6 oz. cream cheese, cut into chunks. Heat and stir or whisk the milk and cheese until it is fully heated through and the cheese has melted into the milk. You\u2019ll want to use a whisk once the cheese begins to melt. Whisk 3\/4 cup grated Parmesan into the milk sauce. Continue to whisk while the mixture heats, allowing it to come up to a gentle simmer. When it reaches a simmer, the sauce will thicken. Once the Parmesan has fully melted in and the sauce has thickened, turn the heat down to low to keep the sauce warm. Season the sauce with 1\/4 tsp salt and a generous amount of freshly cracked pepper. Now it\u2019s time to add the spinach. I buy these huge bags of fresh spinach, which are the same amount as those large tubs you can buy, but it\u2019s only $3.99 (the large tubs are usually more like $5.99). Anyway, add about 4 cups of spinach to the hot alfredo sauce\u2026 And stir it in until it has wilted and limp. This should only take a few minutes. Finally, add the cooked and drained penne pasta and stir until everything is combined and coated in the thick sauce. And that\u2019s it! Now you\u2019re ready to get your pasta on. Seriously though, this Lighter Spinach Alfredo Pasta is rich and creamy without being like, \u201cOMG I just ate a brick.\u201d\\xa0 I\u2019m all about that cracked pepper. \ud83e\udd24 Related Posts Creamy Pesto Mac with Spinach One Pot Creamy Sun Dried Tomato Pasta Creamy Tomato and Spinach Pasta Bacon and Spinach Pasta with Parmesan posted on July 26, 2017 in Egg Free , Main Dish , Pasta Recipes , Quick , Recipe Archives , Sauce , Soy Free 58 Comments \u00bb 58 comments on \u201cLighter Spinach Alfredo Pasta\u201d \u00ab Older Comments Louise \u2014 04.11.20 @ 4:05 pm Reply I loved it Michele \u2014 02.23.20 @ 6:26 pm Reply Yummy! Will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing this. April \u2014 02.22.20 @ 1:04 pm Reply My 12 year old wanted to make a pasta Alfred so I looked up this one and sent her in the kitchen to make it. BEST Alfredo I\u2019ve ever had. Her and the family loves it! Brie \u2014 02.18.20 @ 12:12 pm Reply I made this on a whim to use up some spinach and ground turkey I had in the fridge, and it came out amazing!! It was super easy to make too. I know it\u2019s annoying when someone says \u201cit was great\u2026I just changed this, this, and that\u201d. In this case it was 100% fine just as it is written. However, I was trying to clean out the fridge and pantry without shopping, so I ended up using rotini pasta in lieu of penne since it was what I had, and added ground turkey just to add a bit of protein for my growing boy. He scarfed it down and asked for more! I\u2019d call that a win! I\u2019m definitely adding this to my dinner recipe rotation.\\xa0 Emily \u2014 09.21.19 @ 2:28 pm Reply The sauce was thinner than I would have liked too. I added cornstarch and extra parm. The flavor was good though. I think next time I would start with a roux.

That being said, some people might not mind the difference, so I can\u2019t say for sure whether you\u2019d like it or not. Darlene Chivinsky \u2014 09.17.18 @ 7:02 pm Reply I made this for the first time and it was fabulous. I used evaporated milk instead of regular milk ( I remember using it in your one skillet Mac and Cheese recipe also yummy). This made it extra thick and creamy and how I like it. It was absolutely what I was craving and I was able to use ingredients I already had and needed to use up. Why I love this website so much. Alicia \u2014 08.31.18 @ 8:04 pm Reply Delicious. \\xa0For a protein I added some chopped fried chicken tenders.\\xa0 Michael \u2014 07.15.18 @ 10:26 pm Reply This was a supremely delicious recipe. Amazing. Cristina \u2014 06.12.18 @ 12:01 pm Reply Turned out pretty well! Sauce was not as thick as I wished, but did thicken the longer it sat. Anya \u2014 05.11.18 @ 1:20 pm Reply I thought this was pretty yummy! I ran into the same problem as some other commenters about the sauce not being thick enough, even though I used whole milk. But then, I came back to the website, and noticed I used 3\/4 of shredded parm, not grated! So last minute, I dunked a whole bunch of parm in a can in there, plus 1 tbsp cornstarch mixed with 1 tbsp water. Sauce is the right consistency and pretty yummy. Thank you for the recipe! Laura \u2014 03.22.18 @ 4:31 pm Reply Can I replace milk with heavy whip cream? Beth M \u2014 03.23.18 @ 9:47 am Reply I think that would change the outcome quite a bit. You\u2019d probably need to make other adjustments in the recipe as well, but it\u2019s hard to guess without testing the substitution. Eric Murphy \u2014 01.16.20 @ 11:16 pm Reply I made this recipe its amazing I used half and half insted of milk and it came out like a mac and cheese but it was easy to follow and super fast to cook i put veggie pasta to make more healthy \u00ab Older Comments Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

This recipe is for a large dinner party. Please feel free to scale the recipe down for a small family. Note: Make sure you whisk in the flour early while you are melting the butter with the garlic to avoid a &quot;floury&quot; flavor. The flour is important to avoid a thin sauce. This sauce is very versatile. Add grilled marinated chicken for a great Chicken Alfredo. Add saut&eacute;ed shrimp and scallops with Old Bay Seasoning, white wine, shrimp stock, and chopped green onions for Seafood Alfredo. Extra sauce can be frozen for later use. 34 People talking Join In Now Join the conversation!

You\u2019ll be blown away how good this One Pot Alfredo Pasta is \u2013 the pasta is evenly cooked, the sauce is silky and creamy, not gluggy and thick. This is a game changer!! I\u2019m going to be honest with you, I\u2019ve had some bad experiences with one pot pastas.\\xa0When the one-pot pasta phenomenon started, thanks to Martha Stewart (though many Italians have since pointed out that they\u2019ve been doing it for\\xa0 years , it is just that Martha Stewart\\xa0made it popular and more widely known!), I was really cynical. Orzo, yes, it works great cooked in one pot with the sauce. Even macaroni and other short pasta.\\xa0But long pasta?\\xa0Then I tried Martha\u2019s original recipe and was lulled into a false sense of confidence and jumped right on board the one-pot pasta train. ONE POT ALFREDO PASTA Like \\xa0this recipe? Pin it to your DINNER pinboard! Follow Real Housemoms on Pinterest But then, disaster struck. Enticed by pretty photos, I tried a one pot creamy spaghetti. It was, to be frank (and I will never ever tell where I got the recipe from), bordering on inedible. And I like to think I have a cast iron stomach.\\xa0The pasta was unevenly cooked, the sauce was hideously gluggy, almost gluey.\\xa0It was an absolute disaster. One of the worst\\xa0things to come out of my kitchen in years. Most people would walk away and put it down to a bad recipe. Me? I was fuelled with a challenge. I was determined to come up with a way to make a creamy pasta in one pot.\\xa0It took a few goes but actually wasn\u2019t as hard as I expected. My thinking was that it\u2019s fat in the cream + the starch in the pasta that thickens the sauce. So all I do is add the cream right at the end. If you add it at the beginning, that\u2019s when you end up with gluggy sauce.\\xa0Less than 15 minutes.\\xa0A creamy Alfredo pasta with a luscious silky sauce.\\xa0YES, it\u2019s possible. And it is so, SO good. Want more easy pasta recipes?

I like having a couple sizes \u2013 a longer set for grilling and a shorter set for stovetop cooking. One Pot Alfredo Pasta Yes, you CAN make a creamy alfredo pasta in ONE POT! You'll be blown away how good this One Pot Alfredo Pasta is! Print Recipe Rate Recipe Prep Time: 3 minutes Cook Time: 12 minutes Total Time: 15 minutes Course: Main Dish Servings: 3 Calories: 743 kcal Author: Nagi @RecipeTinEats Ingredients 2 cups milk any fat % 1 1\/2 cups chicken broth 3 tbsp butter 1 large garlic clove minced 8 ounces fettuccine 1\/2 cup heavy cream 3\/4 cup freshly grated parmesan plus more for garnish Salt & pepper to taste Parsley for garnish Instructions Use a skillet large enough to fit the pasta. Place skillet on the stove over medium-high heat. Add milk, chicken broth, butter, and garlic. Bring to simmer then add pasta. Move pasta around every 30 seconds or so until it is softened (around 3 minutes) so it doesn't stick. Once the pasta is softened, reduce heat to medium and stir every couple of minutes. After another 6 minutes or so, the pasta should be almost cooked but there should still be liquid covering the base of the skillet. Add cream and parmesan and mix. Simmer, stirring occasionally, for ~2 minutes, until sauce is thickened and pasta is cooked. If you cook it too long and the sauce goes gluggy, add a splash of hot tap water, it will go back to silky with a few tosses. Adjust salt and pepper to taste and serve immediately, garnished with freshly grated parmesan and parsley!

Shrimp Fettuccine Alfredo Getting reviews... This take on a classic Italian-American recipe is super easy to make. Slightly reducing the cream and adding a hefty dose of cheese means you don't have to use flour to thicken the sauce. Save Recipe Level: Easy Total: 25 min Active: 25 min Yield: 4 servings Share This Recipe Pinterest Facebook Twitter Email Level: Easy Total: 25 min Active: 25 min Yield: 4 servings Ingredients Kosher salt 12 ounces fettuccine Olive oil, for tossing 3\/4 pound large shrimp (about 16), peeled and deveined, tails removed Freshly ground black pepper 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter 2 cups heavy cream 2 pinches freshly grated nutmeg 1 1\/2 cups freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese Directions Bring a large pot of water to a boil, and salt generously. Add the pasta, and boil according to package directions until al dente, tender but still slightly firm. Strain, and toss with a splash of oil. Meanwhile, arrange the shrimp in a single layer on a large pie pan or paper plate, and pat them with a paper towel until completely dry. Season with salt and pepper. Heat a large skillet over medium heat, and add 2 tablespoons of the butter. When the butter melts, raise the heat to medium-high, and invert the plate of shrimp over the skillet so the shrimp fall into the pan all at once. Cook the shrimp, without moving them, until the underside is pink, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip the shrimp, and cook until fully pink and cooked through, about 2 minutes more. Transfer the shrimp to a bowl. Reduce the heat to medium, and add the remaining 6 tablespoons butter. Scrape the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon to release any browned bits. When the butter has mostly melted, whisk in the cream and nutmeg and bring to a simmer, then cook for 2 minutes. Lower the heat to keep the sauce warm. Whisk the Parmigiano-Reggiano into the sauce. Add the shrimp and cooked pasta, and toss well. Season with salt and pepper. Serve hot in heated bowls. Cook\u2019s Note Don't worry if it seems like there is too much sauce. As soon as everything is tossed together, the sauce will start to cling to the pasta and thicken before your eyes. Copyright 2015 Television Food Network, G.P. All rights reserved.

Prev Recipe Next Recipe Recipe courtesy of Food Network Kitchen Shrimp Fettuccine Alfredo 65\\xa0Reviews Level: Easy Yield: 4 servings Total: 25 min Active: 25 min Advertisement Ingredients Kosher salt 12 ounces fettuccine Olive oil, for tossing 3\/4 pound large shrimp (about 16), peeled and deveined, tails removed Freshly ground black pepper 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter 2 cups heavy cream 2 pinches freshly grated nutmeg 1 1\/2 cups freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese Directions Bring a large pot of water to a boil, and salt generously. Add the pasta, and boil according to package directions until al dente, tender but still slightly firm. Strain, and toss with a splash of oil. Meanwhile, arrange the shrimp in a single layer on a large pie pan or paper plate, and pat them with a paper towel until completely dry. Season with salt and pepper. Heat a large skillet over medium heat, and add 2 tablespoons of the butter. When the butter melts, raise the heat to medium-high, and invert the plate of shrimp over the skillet so the shrimp fall into the pan all at once. Cook the shrimp, without moving them, until the underside is pink, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip the shrimp, and cook until fully pink and cooked through, about 2 minutes more. Transfer the shrimp to a bowl. Reduce the heat to medium, and add the remaining 6 tablespoons butter. Scrape the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon to release any browned bits. When the butter has mostly melted, whisk in the cream and nutmeg and bring to a simmer, then cook for 2 minutes. Lower the heat to keep the sauce warm. Whisk the Parmigiano-Reggiano into the sauce. Add the shrimp and cooked pasta, and toss well. Season with salt and pepper. Serve hot in heated bowls. Cook\u2019s Note Don't worry if it seems like there is too much sauce. As soon as everything is tossed together, the sauce will start to cling to the pasta and thicken before your eyes. Copyright 2015 Television Food Network, G.P. All rights reserved.

Half of the calories and you won\u2019t even be able to tell!\\xa0 Carbs. Oh man. Carbs are my WEAKNESS. When I am trying to watch what I eat, chocolate and sweets do not tempt me at all. Its the carbs. I dream all day of a big bowl of pasta and carbs sitting right in front of me. Along with a couple of slices of warm bread. I just love my carbs. Well stuffing your face with carbs is not the best way of losing weight. And because I count macros, I can only can have 40% in my diet to reach my daily goal. So I decided to take my favorite alfredo sauce and change the ingredients and combine it with whole wheat pasta. This alfredo sauce is the best out there. I changed out some of the ingredients to reduce calories and used low fat milk and reduced fat cream cheese. I was able to cut the calories in half and it was absolutely amazing! This is just one of the recipes that you will want to continue making though out the year. I am such a huge believer in keeping things delicious but swapping out for healthier ingredients to keep your goals throughout the year practical and achievable. And I still gotta have my carbs. My reward meal each week usually consists of going with the family to the spaghetti factory and loading up on their famous Brown Butter Mazithra Cheese Spaghetti. This is a meal that the entire family is going to love. It comes together easily and is ready to go onto the dinner table in just about 30 minutes!

Reply Ziva says: January 27, 2016 at 6:10 pm This looks so yummy! Can\u2019t wait to try it. I feel the same way about carbs, skip the sweets \u2013 it\u2019s all about pasta! And the Brown Butter Spaghetti from the spaghetti factory is my favorite too. Would love to see a copycat recipe from you. I\u2019m wondering what the brand of whole wheat fettuchini you used was? It looks so white in the pictures and the generic brands always taste so dense to me. Reply Alyssa says: January 29, 2016 at 8:59 am All I had was a regular fettuchini on hand when photographing this recipe but I make it with whole wheat every time. \ud83d\ude42 Reply Donna says: August 14, 2016 at 12:46 pm Thanks for sharing your low cal version Fettuccini Alfredo. Will try. I tried WW penne and hated it but I have tried WW angel hair that is much lighter in color and had a delicious nutty flavor to it. What brand of WW fettuccini do you suggest? Reply Amber says: November 5, 2017 at 8:24 pm I usually make your original sauce with heavy whipping cream, which is so delicious but too thick and heavy for us. Do you think it\u2019s because I might have it on the heat too long? I\u2019ve even tried to thin it with milk. Will this sauce be less thick? Reply Amber says: July 25, 2018 at 7:19 pm I added mushrooms in place of the crushed garlic and it\u2019s amazing! Reply Sandy says: September 24, 2018 at 4:08 pm This was delicious!

Dressings, Sauces, and Dips The Best Homemade Alfredo Sauce Recipe Ever! by Alyssa Rivers October 24, 2019 Jump to Recipe Favorite Pin 0 Share 0 Alfredo\\xa0Sauce is t he most creamy and delicious homemade alfredo sauce that you will ever make! This is a tried and true recipe and you will agree that it is the best recipe out there! This is my most popular recipe for a good reason! If you love alfredo as much as I do try this Creamy Garlic Shrimp Alfredo Pasta , Instant Pot Chicken Alfredo Pasta or Asiago Garlic Alfredo Pasta .\\xa0 Alfredo Sauce I just had to post my favorite alfredo recipe that I have created here on the blog. There are a few secret ingredients that set it apart from all of the rest. If there is one thing I can always count on my family to eat it is my homemade alfredo sauce over pasta. We recently had some company over for\\xa0dinner and I made these Chicken Bacon Garlic Alfredo Roll Ups and they always are a huge hit! This alfredo sauce is thick and creamy and the flavor is out of the world. It is restaurant quality that you can make right at home! What is Alfredo Sauce Classic Alfredo Sauce is a simple but elegant creamy, white sauce that is commonly known to lay over pasta noodles. It is made from butter, a type of cream and parmesan cheese. Adding seasonings and cream cheese for a thickener I like to blend a rich, creamy sauce together that is simple and irresistible. The end result of this mixture is satisfying to say the least! What you need to make alfredo sauce Simple ingredients for an elegant sauce that is a classic dish loved by all. Alfredo Sauce just has a smooth, creamy texture that melts in your mouth. The best results comes from the ingredients. Using the freshest ingredients is key! Fresh parmesan cheese grated off the block is one of those key ingredients. This will create a smooth textured sauce rather than a grainy one. Each of these ingredients melt and blend together so well creating a masterpiece! Butter: either unsalted or salted work for this alfredo sauce recipe. Heavy whipping cream:\\xa0 for a richer and creamy flavor heavy whipping cream is preferred over whipping cream. Cream cheese: this adds a nice thick consistency to your alfredo sauce. Minced garlic: for best flavoring use fresh garlic and mince it the best you can. Garlic powder: adds to the rich and garlic flavoring. Italian seasoning: brings on an Italian fill and blends all the seasonings together. Salt and pepper: just to taste! Grated parmesan cheese: using real parmesan cheese is best. Powdered cheese will create a grainy texture and does not melt through when heated. How to make Alfredo sauce Creating this master piece does take a little bit of time. We all know that it is worth it! We love Alfredo sauce and it is a quick and easy sauce that can be made in minutes with these simple ingredients. Enjoy alfredo sauce right when you need it! Whisk dairy ingredients together: In a medium saucepan add butter, heavy whipping cream, and cream cheese. Cook over medium heat and whisk until melted. Add and whisk seasonings:\\xa0 Add the minced garlic, garlic powder, italian seasoning, salt and pepper. Continue to whisk until smooth. Stir in cheese:\\xa0 Add the grated parmesan cheese. Thicken your sauce:\\xa0 Bring to a simmer and continue to cook for about 3-5 minutes or until it starts to thicken. Toss with pasta:\\xa0 Toss it with your favorite pasta! Is Alfredo Sauce keto? Yes! This is totally keto! I left out the flour and that makes this keto. Crazy, I know! But such good news! If you are following a low carb diet this can be a great recipe to enjoy while cutting back on other favorite meals. Even though it is keto and considered a low carb recipe, it is still full on creamy, thick and rich alfredo sauce. It will be like dessert in your mouth! This easy to make Alfredo Sauce recipe will have you saying MMMMM and AWW, with every bite. FAQ\u2019s for making Alfredo Sauce This alfredo sauce has delicious garlic flavor and Italian seasonings. I like to add cream cheese to my alfredo for that extra creamy flavor and texture. This alfredo sauce always gets raved about whenever I make it! How to make\\xa0Alfredo Sauce with milk instead cream? Adding milk is always an option. This will be a lighter and less thick consistency but can work. Half and half is also another option instead of heavy whipping cream. To thicken it up a little more adding 1 to 2 teaspoons of flour to thicken. How to make\\xa0Alfredo\\xa0Sauce thicker? When adding cream cheese, slowly cut chunks of cream cheese as you are stirring. This helps create a thicker and creamier sauce. You can also use a roux by using an equal amount of butter to flour, about 1 teaspoon. Is\\xa0Alfredo Sauce gluten free? This recipe is considered gluten free! It still has a great taste and all the fresh ingredients to make this just the way you like it with no substitutions. Is Alfredo Sauce cheese? This is a cheese based sauce that is rich in flavor. It does not harden like a cheese though. Does Alfredo\\xa0sauce have dairy? There are substitutions to make this dairy free but I do not recommend it if you are looking for the authentic taste of Alfredo Sauce. Having dairy in this Alfredo Sauce recipe makes this rich, creamy and smooth when simmering. Is Alfredo Sauce good with ground beef?\\xa0 It can be done, but not recommended. Alfredo sauce goes best with a chicken, fish or pasta. How Many Cups Does this Yield? When you are done making your Alfredo Sauce you will be able to fill a tall canning jar. This is about 14 to 16 ounces (1 pound) of pasta or 2 cups of sauce. We like to reserve a little alfredo sauce on the side for dipping.\\xa0 Tips for making Alfredo Sauce I think this sauce is even better than any restaurant that I have been to and the best part is that you can make it yourself! It is thick, creamy, and rich and the perfect sauce on top of your favorite pasta. I know that you will quickly agree that this is the BEST! This will be a recipe that you make again and again, just like I do! Slowly add in your heavy whipping cream and cream cheese. This will enhance your flavors as well as thicken evenly throughout. Avoid separating your Alfredo Sauce when mixing it by whisking it together rather than stirring with a spatula. Parmesan cheese is the key ingredient for making this Alfredo Sauce thick and creamy. I recommend using a fresh parmesan cheese that you grate yourself or similar. Try to avoid using the powder or grated grated parmesan cheese in a tall can. The most important rule is not overheating your Alfredo Sauce. Slowly add ingredients on a low and for a short period of time. Melted cheese will break and separate once it gets too hot leaving your cheese clumpy. When simmering, a shorter amount of time is best. Around 1 minute, whisking it well. Do not boil or overheat. Boiling will separate and ruin the alfredo sauce. If you are worried about overheating, add your parmesan with the heat off. This will also precent clumping and separating the alfredo sauce. Variations of alfredo sauce There are many variations that can be done with Alfredo Sauce recipe. Adding thickeners or making it more creamy and watery are great ways to adjust this Alfredo Sauce. Substituting any dairy or cheese can have major changes to this alfredo sauce recipe though. For best results, enjoy my delicious Alfredo Sauce recipe that is definitely a tried and true recipe that is pure perfection! Half and half or milk is great to substitute the heavy whipping cream. Grilled chicken, shredding rotisserie chicken or shrimp goes well with pasta. Add in more spices and seasonings like red pepper flakes or paprika for a sweeter and spicier Alfredo Sauce like this\\xa0 One Pot Cajun Chicken Alfredo Pasta . Use half Romano cheese or asiago cheese instead of parmesan cheese. Making your own fresh pasta instead of dry pasta tastes even more amazing. Ways to use Alfredo Sauce This alfredo sauce recipe comes together pretty easily and you will never go back to the jarred alfredo sauce again! \\xa0 It is awesome on top of just about any pasta but is also delicious used as a dip or even spread on pizza . You can\u2019t go wrong where you add your Alfredo Sauce to! Pasta : Any pasta is great with Alfredo Sauce. The thicker and larger is best to soak up the rich, thick and creamy sauce.

Stayed true to the recipe and it is DIVINE!! Reply Anthony Allen says: March 16, 2020 at 8:10 pm My husband loved it! I did too cause it was so easy to make and it\u2019s one I can remember by heart! Thank you Reply Richard Tunner says: March 17, 2020 at 7:54 pm I am starting to cook and this would be a good idea to try. I love Pasta with Alfredo sauce and I guess this is a good time to try making some. Reply Gabby says: March 18, 2020 at 4:12 pm Made this for the second time and added broccoli! LOVE Reply Jordyn says: March 26, 2020 at 3:19 pm This was a great recipe I use all the time . My only problem was gritty . I had a gritty texture but mixed with pasta and veggies it was fabulous Reply Jim Rossi says: March 27, 2020 at 6:45 am Try grated Parmesan, or better yet, Pecorino Romano. I\u2019ve been making fettuccine Alfredo for about 40 years, and this is very similar to the one I learned when I was 16 working at an Italian restaurant. The biggest thing that I can tell everyone is to watch your heat, you\u2019ll curdle the cream and butter with too high of a heat, so keep it down and continue to stir or whisk until everything is incorporated and melted as Allyssa said. The original Alfredo does not have garlic, but I have always added garlic as she does. I haven\u2019t added cream cheese yet, so I think I\u2019ll try it! One last thought, maybe the Italian seasoning is adding the grit? I\u2019ve never added that before, just ground pepper, as the cheese has enough salt to carry it through. Reply Max says: March 27, 2020 at 5:52 pm The tips and recipe for this Alfredo Sauce are absolutely the best. I want to marry you. Oh, I already have the perfect wife. Seriously you are a Saint. Reply Ray Francis says: March 27, 2020 at 11:43 pm You\u2019re the best indeed! I followed your Recipe for making Alfredo sauce with a twist since I used part pecorino cheese and of course, parmesan cheese. I also used half of the cream cheese block with Irish butter. I used the sauce for seafood fetucini. It is an awesome treat, thanks to you, Alyssa! Reply Tina says: March 29, 2020 at 7:33 pm My goodness. Made this for the first time tonite. Followed the recipe exactly, simple to put together but soooo delicious and rich. Used it over spinach fettuccine, slices of Beyond Sausage, saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, and some broccoli. The sauce was perfect, better than in a restaurant. My husband couldn\u2019t get enough of it, he loved it. Thank you for this wonderful recipe! \ud83d\ude0b Reply Ray Francis says: March 27, 2020 at 11:47 pm You\u2019re the best indeed!

I used the sauce for seafood fetucini. It is an awesome treat, thanks to you, Alyssa! Reply Ashley says: March 28, 2020 at 10:05 am Best alfredo sauce I\u2019ve ever made. I always get compliments on it! Thank you. Reply Don Spencer says: March 29, 2020 at 9:53 pm Sorry but I found this sauce far too thick. But thank you you pointed me in the right direction. Actually found it still a bit thick even after omitting the cream cheese but adding just a bit of 3% milk got it right were I wanted it. Probably less than a quarter cup. Sorry didnt measure. The result. Fabulous !!! Reply Christy says: March 30, 2020 at 8:59 am This is my go-to recipe for Alfredo that I have been using for years. Not sure where I first saw it. I usually use salted butter and increase the salt to 1\/2 tsp. I found it bland if I followed the original recipe. I also usually add more Parmesan than the recipe calls for. This helps thicken it more and gives it more cheesy flavor. Reply Amanda Dawn says: March 30, 2020 at 6:49 pm Roughly how much in ounces does 1 batch make? I\u2019m trying to make this bulk to can it. Reply Alyssa Rivers says: April 5, 2020 at 4:42 pm About 16 ounces, a jar full. Reply Vanessa says: April 1, 2020 at 9:34 am Best Alfredo sauce! Most I have made are very bland and don\u2019t have much flavor. Even my hard to please husband really liked it. I\u2019ll use this again! Maybe add chicken or lobster. I used it over ravioli and loved it. Reply Malissa says: April 1, 2020 at 9:24 pm I grew up on Alfredo sauce made from packets and I will never go back to them! This recipe is very simple, fast & delicious. My whole family absolutely loves it. I\u2019ve never made it using cream though, I\u2019ve used whole milk and other times I\u2019ve used half and half. it\u2019s obviously much thinner using milk, but it tastes so good we don\u2019t mind. Plus there\u2019s always left overs & by the next day the sauce absorbs & thickens. I\u2019ve tried a few other Alfredo recipes and was always disappointed. This one has so much flavor. Try it, you won\u2019t regret it. Reply Jill schenck says: April 2, 2020 at 8:07 am The name for this Alfredo sauce is spot on!! It is THE best Alfredo sauce ever! I\u2019ve been making this for my family for about a year and they absolutely love it. This last time I found some homemade fettuccine noodles, and it was amazing. Thank you soooooo much for sharing this award winning recipe! Reply Rick says: April 3, 2020 at 3:05 pm Been making this recipe for a while. I use light cream and a little less cream cheese . I also saut\u00e9s baby Bella mushrooms and add ham cut into very tiny cubes and add to recipe . My family can\u2019t get enough. Reply Steve says: April 5, 2020 at 10:44 am I made this for my Granddaughter\u2019s 21st Birthday dinner\u2026.she loves Alfredo! I prepared some with saut\u00e9ed chicken and some with saut\u00e9ed shrimp and the family absolutely loved it! The only change I made was using a creamier European butter. Thank you! It was out of this world! Reply Catherine says: April 9, 2020 at 8:11 pm Will never order Alfredo sauce from a restaurant again. This is better, and so easy. So happy I found this website! Will try shrimp and grits next. Reply Tony Sandrin says: April 11, 2020 at 5:36 am Hi, We just love this sauce. I recently started making my own pasta as well. My adult kids have asked for the recipie and I refuse to give it to them for FEAR of not being invited back for supper again LOL. I was wondering if you can double this recipe or it best to make one batch at a time. Reply Sadia says: April 11, 2020 at 6:52 pm I never leave reviews but I had to for this one. This is by far the best tasting Alfredo recipe. My whole family loves it even my picky two year old. Thank you for such a great recipe. Reply Jenna says: April 12, 2020 at 6:45 pm This recipe was excellent! My husband and kids are SUPER picky and they all loved it!! Thank you \ud83d\ude42 I will definitely make this again Reply Tony Sandrin says: April 15, 2020 at 6:41 am Hi, I love this sauce and wouldn\u2019t change it for the world. Your right , reheating on high separates the cream and tastes like hell. I need your expertise . \u2026 I plan to make fresh home made cannelloni and it calls for a mixture of Alfredo sauce and tomato sauce as a topping. Im wondering if this recipe will separate the cream if I bake it ? Would substituting 1\/2 & 1\/2 resolve this issue . Thanks Tony Reply Tiffany says: April 15, 2020 at 6:10 pm The star rating isn\u2019t working,anyway, this is great! Easy and tastes fantastic!! Thank you for sharing I will Be making this again and again. Reply Jeff Winett says: April 16, 2020 at 9:12 am Add me to the growing legion as a fan of your recipe. For way too long I would strictly follow the recipes that were touted as being the ONLY authentic Alfredo\u2026.the ones where you just emulsify butter with high quality Parmesan. These pastas were good enough, but never gave me the same feelings as when I was a kid, enjoying restaurant Fettuccine Alfredo. I made your recipe for the first time last night, and instantly, I was that happy kid again. Let anyone say that \u201ccream cheese\u201d is totally a no-no for true Alfredo\u2026I believe this allows the sauce to remain creamy and emulsified. Anyway, last night I mixed in some cooked chicken thigh, and was in heaven. My next iteration will be your sauce, and then shower crispy bacon over the dish. Thank you, thank you, thank you for this! Reply joyce says: April 16, 2020 at 11:14 am I tried it this past weekend. It is indeed\u2026hands down\u2026the best alfredo sauce I\u2019ve ever tasted. My daughter wanted chicken in it for her birthday, but it didn\u2019t need anything in it. Just a vegetable or a salad and garlic bread if you want to. Broccoli would be a good vegetable. Thank you so much for sharing. Reply Sean says: April 17, 2020 at 3:59 am I made this last night..Amazing is all I have to say\u2026best recipe..ever Reply Brandy says: April 19, 2020 at 9:59 pm I have been using this recipe for a while now. However, more recently, I have noticed something has changed. What is different from the first time this was published? It doesn\u2019t seem as flavorful as it once was. Reply Alyssa Rivers says: April 23, 2020 at 3:31 am I have not changed anything to the recipe. I have only updated photos and my writing structure. Still the same! Reply Emily says: April 20, 2020 at 4:44 pm I rarely comment on recipes but I\u2019ve made this now 4-5 times and it is INSANELY good, best Alfredo I\u2019ve ever tasted. My whole family loves it- and it is SO easy to make. Followed the recipe exactly each time. Reply Vicky says: April 22, 2020 at 9:31 am Love the recipe! It is amaaaazing Reply Candy Nickson says: April 23, 2020 at 7:54 am I\u2019ve been using this recipe for quite a while now, and refuse to make my alfredo sauce any other way! I absolutely love this recipe \u2763 and so do my friends and family\u2026 Best ever!!!! Reply Lisa E says: April 23, 2020 at 8:05 pm Great. Followed recipe exactly but did a tad less of cream cheese and used half and half instead of heavy cream. Glorious. Added chicken and broccoli. Reply Carmen says: April 24, 2020 at 8:43 pm Really good! First time making Alfredo sauce and it was great! I will make again, thank you! Reply Colin says: April 26, 2020 at 3:17 am Made it tonight and came out great. Thanks for sharing it with us. Reply Hope Bloom says: April 26, 2020 at 9:43 am This was my first time making alfredo sauce, and I served it over fettuccine. The sauce was awesome! I followed the directions exactly, and it was very easy to make. The flavor was rich and creamy. The garlic and Italian seasoning add a nice amount of flavor. This will be my go-to alfredo sauce! Reply Danielle says: April 27, 2020 at 10:53 am Thank you so much for this easy, delicious alfredo recipe! I\u2019m looking too create a variety of dishes for my family and this was an absolute hit! I will no longer look to the restaurants to satisfy my desire for creamy alfredo pasta. Reply Comment navigation Older Comments Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

It\u2019s absolutely decadent, made with a cashew cream sauce, and the sauce is made easily in your blender! Where do I start? You\u2019re going to absolutely love and want to devour this Vegan Garlic Alfredo Pasta. I\u2019m talking cheesy, creamy, absolutely indulgent in taste kind of pasta dinner. The kind of dinner that totally hits the spot, and makes you want to curl up on a Friday night. Without the heavy feeling, of course. All my pasta cravings are hereby conquered. First things first \u2013 I haven\u2019t been a big pasta fanatic. LET me be clear. When a pasta dish is done well \u2013 I am all for that. If you\u2019re a vegetarian or a vegan though, you know that\\xa0 lots of pasta dishes just are\\xa0 not done correctly. Kind of a leftover, oh yeah whoops, kind of scenario, and it can drive you to never want to have pasta again. WHAT a terrible nightmarish scenario. Fortunately, after making this Vegan Garlic Alfredo Pasta, I now know I have the best pasta dish sitting and waiting at home on me! You\u2019re going to want to grab some cashews right now so that you can make this for dinner, friends. Let\u2019s talk key ingredients. That roasted garlic is a\\xa0 must . I mean, it deepens the flavour of the entire sauce, and really brings it to another level. You\u2019re going to have to wait for your cashews to soak anyway, so you might as well make it. I guarantee it\u2019ll change all of your dishes. Speaking of which, cashews. OMG. Adding soaked cashews to this sauce makes it so creamy and gives it that traditional white colour. No, the sauce won\u2019t taste like cashews, thanks to the addition of another ingredient: lemon or lime juice. This acid helps to neutralise the cashew flavour so all you taste is the cheesiness. The nutritional yeast and the vegan parmesan cheese! I speak all about nutritional yeast here , and I made a vegan parmesan cheese for you here. You can also buy your vegan parm though, so it\u2019s totally up to you. That extra bit of tanginess really ups the sauce, and you can add eons of it on top too. The nutritional yeast in the Alfredo sauce gives it that cheesy flavour, that will have you taste testing the heck out of this sauce. Almond milk and pasta water! Don\u2019t use regular water! Pasta water already has some saltiness, some starch, and is a perfectly seasoned form of water in this sauce. The almond milk of course adds more creaminess. Basically what I\u2019m saying is, friends, every ingredient is key here. Including the cooked down onions (adding a nice flavour + umami). What you get is a beautiful vegan Alfredo sauce recipe made in your blender that you can pour back on your pasta and then dig in. The kind of sauce you\u2019ll probably want to put on anything, but will definitely slather all over your pasta. That\u2019s it! Your pasta dreams have come true! Dive in friends, and enjoy! \\xa0 Vegan Garlic Alfredo Pasta by: Jessica in the Kitchen Prep Time 1 minute Cook Time 15 minutes Total Time 16 minutes Course Dinner, Lunch Keyword Dairy Free, Egg Free, Nut Free, Soy Free, vegan, Vegetarian Print Share Facebook Twitter Google+ Pinterest Yummly Tumblr Email 5 from 3 votes Ingredients Pasta 12 ounces any pasta I used fettuccine chopped parsley for garnish Vegan Alfredo Sauce 2 teaspoons vegan butter or olive oil 1\/2 red onion chopped 1 cup cashews soaked overnight, or in hot water for one hour 1\/4 cup pasta water 1 \u00bd cups unsweetened almond milk 4 cloves roasted garlic* 2 tablespoons nutritional yeast \u00bd teaspoon sea salt 2 tablespoons vegan parmesan cheese + extra for topping 1 tablespoon lime juice Instructions Instructions Cook pasta according to package directions in a well salted pot of water. Reserve \u00bc cup of the pasta water. While the pasta is boiling\/you're waiting for the water to boil, in a pan over medium high heat, heat the vegan butter or olive oil. Add the onion, stir and let cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Remove the onions from the pan and add it to a blender. Add the rinsed off soaked cashews (without the water), the pasta water, the almond milk, the roasted garlic, the nutritional yeast, the sea salt the vegan parmesan cheese and the lime juice. Blend it all together until completely creamy. If you have a high powered blender this will happen quickly, about 1 minute, if not, just keep blending until completely smooth and creamy. Taste and add more salt or vegan parmesan cheese if necessary. When the pasta is finished boiling, drain and pour back into the pan you had used earlier or even into a Tupperware container if you want. Pour the Alfredo sauce over and stir to combine completely. When serving, top with parsley to garnish and more vegan parmesan cheese. Enjoy! Video NOTES *YES roasted garlic takes about 40 minutes, but you\u2019ll need to wait for your cashews to soak for an hour at least anyway! Cut a bit of the tops off of a whole head of garlic, put it in foil, drizzle olive oil on it, wrap the foil around it and cook it at 450 degrees F for 45 minutes in your oven until the cloves are soft and velvety! Allow it to cool, then push the cloves out. \\xa0 You can reheat this! Just reheat it in a stove top over medium high heat with a bit more almond milk to thin it out again until hot. Prep time doesn\u2019t include soaking the cashews overnight. by Jessica _-jbxMmYlqE Share This Post Post navigation \u2039\u2039 Older Posts Newer Posts \u203a\u203a You Might Also Like 10 Favourite Vegan Pumpkin Recipes to Celebrate Fall Read More Vegan Arancini \u2013 Fried Rice Balls (Air Fryer Option!)

Sooo I made this receipe last night and the Alfredo sauce came out liquidity. Your recipe calls for 1 1\/2 cup of almond milk? I think I should\u2019ve used about a cup. Any suggestions? Anywho, I\u2019m going to make it again and I won\u2019t use so much milk this time around. Thanks for sharing this recipe! April 6, 2018 Reply Jessica says: Hi Cynthia! I hope I can help you out! ? What do you mean by came out liquidity\/liquidy? If you look in one of the photos you can see that it definitely is pourable and creamy like most homemade Alfredo sauces, but not thin at all, but once it clings to the warm noodles will thicken up almost immediately once coated around. Did that happen to for you? Either way if you want it much thicker you can definitely use less milk! I hope that helps!! You\u2019re so welcome and I hope you enjoy!

It actually reminded me of the cheese sauce I used to make to go with pasta in my pre vegan days. I added some veges and mustard to it and will definitely make it again \u2026 and again \u2026 May 12, 2018 Reply Gavin | Jessica in the Kitchen says: Wow thanks so much Marina! We\u2019re so glad you enjoyed our Alfredo sauce! The addition of veggies and mustard sound great! Thanks for trying our recipe! May 13, 2018 Reply Shanasy says: Made this last night. I needed an alfredo sauce that didn\u2019t require cauliflower \u2013 and this fit the bill. I saved time by not roasting the garlic (I just sauteed it with the onion). I didn\u2019t have any vegan parmesan so I replaced it with the block cheese made by Daiya Jalapeno\/Havarti flavor and OMG this recipe was sooooo good. It was creamy and cheesy! Thank you! August 8, 2018 Reply Courtney says: I really want to try this recipe out! But where I live I cannot find the nutritional yeast or vegan parmesan cheese anywhere. What could I use as a substitute for them? September 27, 2018 Reply Jessica says: Hi Courtney, Where do you live? Maybe I could help based on that since there isn\u2019t a readily easy substitute for the nutritional yeast. Can you order it online? You could make the vegan parmesan cheese using this recipe: https:\/\/jessicainthekitchen.com\/how-to-make-vegan-parmesan-cheese\/ September 27, 2018 Reply Kara says: I made this for my mum and I for dinner last night. She\u2019s not vegan, and was incredibly skeptical about trying this, but she actually liked it! I liked it too. It was very creamy and delicious. I will absolutely be making this again in the future. I suggest adding more salt and some pepper for a bit more flavour, though. October 17, 2018 Reply Angela says: I\u2019ve actually made this twice. Both times it was scrumptious. Thanks for the recipe. It\u2019s the best vegan Alfredo I\u2019ve had. I think the red onion is what sets it apart. And in case anyone is curious, it worked fine with home-made oat milk instead of almond milk.

First things first \u2013 I haven\u2019t been a big pasta fanatic. LET me be clear. When a pasta dish is done well \u2013 I am all for that. If you\u2019re a vegetarian or a vegan though, you know that\\xa0 lots of pasta dishes just are\\xa0 not done correctly. Kind of a leftover, oh yeah whoops, kind of scenario, and it can drive you to never want to have pasta again. WHAT a terrible nightmarish scenario. Fortunately, after making this Vegan Garlic Alfredo Pasta, I now know I have the best pasta dish sitting and waiting at home on me! You\u2019re going to want to grab some cashews right now so that you can make this for dinner, friends. Let\u2019s talk key ingredients. That roasted garlic is a\\xa0 must . I mean, it deepens the flavour of the entire sauce, and really brings it to another level. You\u2019re going to have to wait for your cashews to soak anyway, so you might as well make it. I guarantee it\u2019ll change all of your dishes. Speaking of which, cashews. OMG. Adding soaked cashews to this sauce makes it so creamy and gives it that traditional white colour. No, the sauce won\u2019t taste like cashews, thanks to the addition of another ingredient: lemon or lime juice. This acid helps to neutralise the cashew flavour so all you taste is the cheesiness. The nutritional yeast and the vegan parmesan cheese! I speak all about nutritional yeast here , and I made a vegan parmesan cheese for you here. You can also buy your vegan parm though, so it\u2019s totally up to you. That extra bit of tanginess really ups the sauce, and you can add eons of it on top too. The nutritional yeast in the Alfredo sauce gives it that cheesy flavour, that will have you taste testing the heck out of this sauce. Almond milk and pasta water! Don\u2019t use regular water! Pasta water already has some saltiness, some starch, and is a perfectly seasoned form of water in this sauce. The almond milk of course adds more creaminess. Basically what I\u2019m saying is, friends, every ingredient is key here. Including the cooked down onions (adding a nice flavour + umami). What you get is a beautiful vegan Alfredo sauce recipe made in your blender that you can pour back on your pasta and then dig in. The kind of sauce you\u2019ll probably want to put on anything, but will definitely slather all over your pasta. That\u2019s it! Your pasta dreams have come true! Dive in friends, and enjoy! \\xa0 Vegan Garlic Alfredo Pasta by: Jessica in the Kitchen Prep Time 1 minute Cook Time 15 minutes Total Time 16 minutes Course Dinner, Lunch Keyword Dairy Free, Egg Free, Nut Free, Soy Free, vegan, Vegetarian Print Share Facebook Twitter Google+ Pinterest Yummly Tumblr Email 5 from 3 votes Ingredients Pasta 12 ounces any pasta I used fettuccine chopped parsley for garnish Vegan Alfredo Sauce 2 teaspoons vegan butter or olive oil 1\/2 red onion chopped 1 cup cashews soaked overnight, or in hot water for one hour 1\/4 cup pasta water 1 \u00bd cups unsweetened almond milk 4 cloves roasted garlic* 2 tablespoons nutritional yeast \u00bd teaspoon sea salt 2 tablespoons vegan parmesan cheese + extra for topping 1 tablespoon lime juice Instructions Instructions Cook pasta according to package directions in a well salted pot of water. Reserve \u00bc cup of the pasta water. While the pasta is boiling\/you're waiting for the water to boil, in a pan over medium high heat, heat the vegan butter or olive oil. Add the onion, stir and let cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Remove the onions from the pan and add it to a blender. Add the rinsed off soaked cashews (without the water), the pasta water, the almond milk, the roasted garlic, the nutritional yeast, the sea salt the vegan parmesan cheese and the lime juice. Blend it all together until completely creamy. If you have a high powered blender this will happen quickly, about 1 minute, if not, just keep blending until completely smooth and creamy. Taste and add more salt or vegan parmesan cheese if necessary. When the pasta is finished boiling, drain and pour back into the pan you had used earlier or even into a Tupperware container if you want. Pour the Alfredo sauce over and stir to combine completely. When serving, top with parsley to garnish and more vegan parmesan cheese. Enjoy! Video NOTES *YES roasted garlic takes about 40 minutes, but you\u2019ll need to wait for your cashews to soak for an hour at least anyway! Cut a bit of the tops off of a whole head of garlic, put it in foil, drizzle olive oil on it, wrap the foil around it and cook it at 450 degrees F for 45 minutes in your oven until the cloves are soft and velvety! Allow it to cool, then push the cloves out. \\xa0 You can reheat this! Just reheat it in a stove top over medium high heat with a bit more almond milk to thin it out again until hot. Prep time doesn\u2019t include soaking the cashews overnight. by Jessica _-jbxMmYlqE Share This Post Post navigation \u2039\u2039 Older Posts Newer Posts \u203a\u203a You Might Also Like Chocolate Chia Pudding (5 Ingredients, Vegan, Low Carb) Read More How To Make Cashew Cream (The Ultimate Dairy Free Substitute) Read More Easy Grilled Pineapples (aka Caramelised Pineapples) Read More leave a comment Cancel reply Recipe Rating 40 comments Comment navigation Older Comments Erica says: I\u2019m allergic to cashews, what would you suggest?

So, make extra and freeze it, it\u2019s AMAZING!!! February 21, 2019 Reply Gavin | Jessica in the Kitchen says: Thank you so much Michele! We love your feedback! Thanks so much for your kind words! February 24, 2019 Trena Stoute says: Great recipe, been meaning to try a cashew alternative for this sauce but was hesitant that it would have a strong nutty flavor but this was creamy and great cheese flavor, like another writer above I added some extra salt and pepper (personal preference). Made your vegan parmesan as well, also super impressed. Will definitely make both again. February 1, 2019 Reply Jessica says: Hi Trena, I\u2019m so happy to hear that, and so happy you enjoyed the vegan parm also! Thanks so much for sharing. February 3, 2019 Reply Alissa says: This was wonderful! So creamy and flavorful. I tried one other recipe in the past with cauliflower and didn\u2019t really care for it. This sauce was exactly what I hoped for. I added a ton of black pepper, which gave it a cacio e pape feel. I served it over Banza chickpea shells with Beyond Meat sausage and broccoli all mixed together. People ask if I feel deprived eating veggie\/vegan and it\u2019s sauces like this that make it easy to say no! Thank you. April 4, 2019 Reply chloe says: should i use pre squeezed lime juice from a bottle, or should i buy a fresh lime and squeeze it myself? April 10, 2019 Reply Jessica says: Hi Chloe, Fresh lime would be best! I hope that helps!! April 10, 2019 Reply Clare says: This recipe is everything it promises and more! The onion and roasted garlic give the sauce depth of flavor and the nutritional yeast and vegan Parmesan make this sauce absolutely decadent. My only variation was to use oat milk in place of almond milk and it worked perfectly. This sauce will keep in the fridge for several days and actually tastes better when the flavors are left to meld a bit. I will NEVER go back to dairy-based Alfredo. This is my new \u201cgo-to\u201d recipe for a velvety, cheesy, satisfying sauce! July 23, 2019 Reply Courtney | Jessica in the Kitchen says: Hi Clare! that substitution does sound yummy!

December 3, 2019 Reply Jessica says: Hi Madison, I haven\u2019t tried roasted cashews, so I can\u2019t guarantee, but I don\u2019t see why it wouldn\u2019t work! As long as they aren\u2019t salted! I hope you enjoy! \ud83d\ude42 December 3, 2019 Reply Maria says: This recipe is divine!!! The sauce is so cheezy it\u2019s hard to believe there\u2019s no cheese in it. I added a bit of full-fat coconut milk for extra creaminess, and stirred in some sauteed mushrooms at the very end. My husband loved it so much he went back for thirds.

Of course there are tons of jarred pasta sauces you can buy, but making alfredo sauce from scratch is actually so easy. This is a great base recipe for all your one-pot pasta needs. Consider the following revisions when you feel like mixing it up. If you\\'re looking for a richer sauce, substitute heavy cream or half and half for the milk\u2014never a bad move. Big fan of dark meat? Swap in thighs for breasts ! Just make sure you give them ample cooking time. Thighs take much longer in the pan, and actually cook best with a quick trip to the oven. Our garlic butter baked chicken thighs utilize this technique, and they\\'re BOMB. Get experimental with the noodles : fettuccini is a classic, but angel hair or spaghetti would work just fine! Just make sure whatever pasta you choose can be completely submerged in your cooking liquid. Feel like you need some veg? Stir in a couple big handfuls of spinach and some halved grape tomatoes after the pasta is cooked. If you\\'re missing crunch, toast up some panko bread crumbs in a skillet with butter and garnish with a handful. This trick works for any pasta, the added texture really takes it over the top.

Please read my disclosure policy . This Chicken Alfredo Baked Ziti recipe is made with a lightened-up alfredo sauce, it\u2019s easy to customize with extra veggies and seasonings, and it is always so comforting and delicious. Creamy, cozy, cheesy, carb-y comfort food alert. \u2661 This time of year, when everyone seems to be craving warm pasta dinners around the table on chilly winter nights, this chicken alfredo baked ziti recipe always goes viral here on the blog.\\xa0 And this time of year, when I make a batch for myself, I\u2019m always reminded how unbeatable this Italian casserole will always be.\\xa0 I mean, creamy alfredo sauce, savory chicken, hearty pasta, two delicious kinds of melty cheese \u2014 what\u2019s not to love?!\\xa0 There\u2019s a reason why this one will always be a classic. That said, while this recipe already features my lightened-up alfredo sauce recipe, there are all sorts of other ways you can make this comfort food a bit healthier if you\u2019d like.\\xa0 From subbing in whole wheat pasta ( this one \\xa0is my go-to), to adding in your choice of veggies (we\u2019re quite partial to broccoli in our house), to making it all gluten-free if you\u2019d like (easy to do with a few simple tweaks), options to customize this casserole abound.\\xa0 And bonus, it can be ready to serve a big crowd in less than 45 minutes. Who\u2019s ready for a helping? My original photo for this recipe from 2014. Chicken Alfredo Baked Ziti Ingredients: To make this Chicken Alfredo Baked Ziti recipe, you will need: Pasta:\\xa0 Feel free to use any shape (ziti, penne, fettuccine, etc.) and variety (classic, whole-wheat , gluten-free, etc.) of pasta that you prefer. Shredded, cooked chicken:\\xa0 I either shred a rotisserie chicken, or use leftovers from this baked chicken breasts recipe. Shredded mozzarella cheese:\\xa0 Feel free to use part-skim or full-fat. Alfredo sauce:\\xa0 We will use my lightened-up alfredo sauce recipe, made simply with olive oil (or butter), garlic, flour, chicken stock, low-fat milk, Parmesan, salt and pepper.\\xa0 Also, this recipe is not naturally very saucy.\\xa0 So if you would like, many of our readers recommend doubling the sauce . Toppings:\\xa0 Freshly-grated Parmesan is a must, in my book.\\xa0 And feel free to sprinkle on some chopped parsley for extra freshness and flavor. Also, see below for suggestions on other delicious ingredients you can add in to this easy baked ziti.\\xa0 (Here\u2019s lookin\u2019 at you, broccoli and Cajun seasoning. \u2661 ) How To Make Chicken Alfredo Baked Ziti: Alright, let\u2019s talk about how to make baked ziti!\\xa0 Simply\u2026 Prepare\\xa0the alfredo sauce.\\xa0\\xa0 To make the alfredo recipe, just saut\u00e9 some garlic in olive oil (or butter).\\xa0 Stir in some flour to thicken, add stock and milk and bring to a simmer.\\xa0 Then stir in the Parmesan, season with salt and pepper, and you\u2019re ready to go! Cook the pasta (and chicken).\\xa0\\xa0 Meanwhile, do some multi-tasking and cook your pasta according to package instructions in a large pot of generously-salted water.\\xa0 Also, if you are cooking your chicken from scratch (vs. using leftovers or shredding a rotisserie), go ahead and cook it while the pasta and sauce are being prepared. Layer everything together.\\xa0 Once your pasta, sauce, and chicken are all ready to go, it\u2019s time to combine everything!\\xa0 In your pasta pot, stir together the pasta, alfredo sauce and chicken until combined.\\xa0 Then spread half of the pasta mixture out evenly in a 9 x 13-inch baking dish.\\xa0 Sprinkle on half of the mozzarella.\\xa0 And repeat with the remaining pasta mixture, and remaining half of the mozzarella. Bake.\\xa0 Transfer the pan to the oven and bake (uncovered) for 20 minutes, or until the cheese is completely melted and has started to brown a bit on top. Add toppings.\\xa0\\xa0 Remove and sprinkle with lots of freshly-grated Parmesan and finely-chopped fresh parsley, if desired. Serve.\\xa0\\xa0 Then dish it up while it\u2019s still nice and warm, and enjoy! Possible Variations: There are\\xa0so many ways to customize this chicken alfredo bake!\\xa0 For example, feel free to\u2026 Add in veggies.\\xa0 Broccoli, asparagus, mushrooms, cauliflower, and any number of other veggies\\xa0would be delicious added to this chicken alfredo recipe.\\xa0 Just note that they won\u2019t get cooked much during the 20 minutes of baking time.\\xa0 So if whatever veggies you add require a longer cooking time, feel free to toss them into the boiling water with the pasta for a few minutes or saut\u00e9 (or roast) them for a few minutes before adding them to the casserole. Add in extra Italian herbs.\\xa0 If you would like an herbier chicken alfredo pasta, feel free to add some dried Italian seasoning or chopped fresh Italian herbs into the alfredo sauce.\\xa0 (Or, you can also sprinkle some chopped fresh basil on top of the pasta after baking.) Nix the protein.\\xa0 Not into chicken?\\xa0 Feel free to use shrimp in this recipe instead.\\xa0 (Or make it vegetarian and add in some extra veggies instead.) Make it spicy.\\xa0 I really love\\xa0sprinkling lots of crushed red pepper into (and on top of) this casserole to give it a bit of a kick. Make it cajun.\\xa0 To give this recipe a Cajun twist, feel free to\\xa0stir 1-2 tablespoons Cajun seasoning (to taste) into the alfredo sauce. Make it gluten-free.\\xa0\\xa0 Just use your favorite certified gluten-free pasta, and my gluten-free alfredo sauce recipe .

I used 2% milk and half &#038;half because that\u2019s what I had. So quick, the sauce was done before the pasta! Will be making this a lot in the future. By: Wendy Ali, I have loved every recipe of yours I\u2019ve made, but this Alfredo recipe stands alone atop the podium (very, very close to your pork carnitas, which was first til now!). I used your sauce as a base for a tossed chicken and spinach penne, and I wanted to dive into a pool of the sauce. So delicious! Thank you for sharing your culinary creativity and talent. By: Jennifer We loved this sauce!!! By: Digna Ali, I made Alfredo sauce a couple of weeks ago - similar recipe that I altered quite a bit. It was loved by my husband and adult grandson, my taste team and best critics. I didn&#039;t have cream so used only 1\/2&#038;1\/2 but will be trying your version this week. Our nice April weather turned dreary suddenly with rain and even light snow this morning, so it&#039;ll be a perfect dinner tonight. I depend on your recipes to keep my meals varied and different. By: Ali That works too! Half and half can be difficult to find in some countries, so I just went with half cream and half milk. :) By: Ali Sure thing, that should work well. Enjoy! :) By: Beth Wilson Hi, Can we use half and half, in lieu of the heavy cream? Unfortunately, organic (which is my choice) heavy cream, contains nasty fillers or stabilizers. The organic half &#038; half, does not. Thanks! And that looks delicious. Beth By: Kathy Why not use half and half instead of cream and milk? By: Kate I haven&#039;t made this yet, but it looks great to try!!! Could&#039;ve used this last week but will be making the same dish again - alfredo + squash (or pumpkin or sweet potato). Also, was just perusing old recipes for ideas of ways to use my pantry items and saw that you used to do Mailbox Mondays where you answered questions from readers. Can this come back please?!

It\\'s creamy, cheesy, carb-y, and super super flavorful. We especially love this version because the shrimp adds lots of extra flavor and some lean protein to boot! Make sure to avoid the common mistakes listed below and you\\'ll master this dish in no time. Overcooking the pasta. Nothing is worse than a bowl of mushy pasta. We\\'re going for\\xa0 al dente in this recipe\u2014aka it should still have some bite. This can be especially tricky when you\\'re adding cooked pasta back to a hot pan because it will actually get cooked a little bit more. We recommend tasting your pasta for doneness a 3 to 4 minutes before the box recommends. There should still be a bit of firmness in the center of your fettuccine. That means, given a little extra cooking time in the skillet you make the sauce in, it\\'ll come out perfectly.\\xa0 Overcooking the shrimp. Never underestimate how fast shrimp can cook. Depending on their size and the heat of your pan they could cook in literally one minute, so keep an eye on them!\\xa0As soon as they turn from gray and translucent to pink and opaque, they\\'re good to go! Set them aside on a plate and continue with the sauce. Just don\\'t ditch anything they\\'ve left behind in the pan!\\xa0Those juices (sorry) will help flavor your sauce and make it\\xa0 so\\xa0 much better. Curdling the sauce. One of the secrets to making an extra creamy alfredo sauce is the addition of an egg yolk. In order to incorporating that yolk without cooking it, you need to make the sauce in a specific order. After you\\'ve added your flour, add your cold milk and cream\\xa0 first , so that when you drop your yolk in, it won\\'t start cooking immediately. When you\\xa0 do\\xa0 drop your yolk in, whisk it in to the sauce immediately and you won\\'t have any problems. If it still sounds risky to you, you can whisk together your heavy cream, milk, and yolk and pour it into your pan as a homogenous mixture. Using cheap parm. This creamy sauce is totally dependent on the cheese. Most of the pre-grated parmesan cheeses sold at the grocery store are mixed with preservatives in order to prevent caking and keep the pre-grated cheese dry. Unfortunately, this can lead to a less than favorable texture, and can make it more difficult for the cheese to melt. If you can, splurge for a real piece of Parmigiano Reggiano (or another hard cheese like Locatelli or Pecorino Romano). It\\'ll make your alfredo sauce a bit more smooth and creamy.\\xa0 Read More + Read Less - Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Yields: 4 Prep Time: 0 hours 15 mins Total Time: 0 hours 25 mins Ingredients 1 lb. fetuccine 3 tbsp. butter, divided 1 lb. shrimp, peeled and deveined, tails removed kosher salt Freshly ground black pepper 2 cloves garlic, minced 2 tbsp. all-purpose flour 1 c. heavy cream 1\/2 c. whole milk 1 egg yolk 1 c. freshly grated Parmesan, plus more for garnish 1 tbsp. Chopped parsley, for garnish Directions Cook fettuccine according to the instructions on box, reserving a cup of pasta water to thicken the sauce, if needed. In a large skillet over medium heat, heat 1 tablespoon butter until melted. Add shrimp, season with salt and pepper and cook until pink and completely opaque, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove shrimp from skillet and set aside. Into the pan, add remaining 2 tablespoons butter and garlic. Cook until the garlic becomes fragrant, about 1 minute. Whisk in flour and cook until no longer raw, 2 minutes. Stir in heavy cream and milk, then whisk in egg yolk.\\xa0 Bring to a low simmer and whisk in parmesan. When cheese is melted and sauce has thickened slightly, add\\xa0cooked pasta and shrimp, tossing to combine. Season with salt and pepper. Garnish with more parmesan and parsley.

It\u2019s as easy as my Instant Pot Taco Pasta ! The Best Chicken Alfredo Pasta You know that dreamy restaurant-style alfredo pasta you crave on the regular and wish you could make at home?

It practically makes itself and produces rich, creamy, delicious results every time! How to Make Chicken Alfredo Pasta in the Instant Pot Break uncooked fettucini noodles in half and scatter them in the instant pot in multiple directions. Think of it like a bird\u2019s nest where noodles aren\u2019t resting parallel to each other, but rather stacked in multiple directions. Scatter butter pieces over the noodles. Pour in liquids and press pasta noodles under the surface of the liquid. Place uncooked chicken (breast or thighs) on top of the pasta and sprinkle in seasonings. *Note: you can cut the chicken into pieces before pressure cooking or shred it after cooking\u2026your choice. (I prefer to shred it after). See recipe below for details. Pressure cook for +5 min on high pressure with a 10 min NPR (natural pressure release). Open the lid, transfer chicken to a plate, confirm 165\u00b0 minimum internal temperature, let it rest a minute, and shred it. Use tongs to stir the pasta noodles and liquid together. Add parmesan cheese, stirring until sauce thickens. Add shredded chicken to the pasta, serve, and devour. * See full recipe below Grab my easy Instant Pot recipes Alfredo Pasta Instant Pot Cooking tips Things to know before you close the Instant Pot lid No pre-cooking : Calling all non -cooks and Instant Pot newbs\u2026this Instant Pot Chicken Alfredo is a dump-and-start recipe. I got you! How to prevent pasta clumping : When adding the uncooked fettuccini noodles to the Instant Pot, break them in half and scatter them in the pot, avoiding stacking them in bundles. Once you\u2019ve added the liquids, don\u2019t stir, just press the noodles down under the liquid surface. Do I use raw or cooked chicken for Chicken Alfredo? This Instant Pot chicken recipe was developed using raw chicken. You could use pre-cooked chicken if you like, but you would add it to the alfredo pasta after the cook cycle has completed to prevent drying out. Chicken breast or chicken thighs : Your choice! Chicken breast is the leaner cut, so it\u2019s quite popular. But chicken thighs seem to never dry out, even as reheated leftovers. Either cut will rock this Instant Pot chicken recipe, but make sure to use the boneless skinless version of either. It\u2019s more convenient than removing bone and skin and reduces the total fat and cholesterol. Cut up the raw chicken before or after cooking? You are welcome to cut the uncooked chicken breast or thighs into pieces before pressure cooking. However, I prefer to pressure cook them as whole pieces and shred after cooking. This reduces raw-chicken handling, produces fewer dishes, AND helps prevent drying out. FYI, if you go this route, you\u2019ll want to confirm a minimum internal temperature of 165\u00b0 with a meat thermometer at the end of the pressure cooking cycle. After you open the lid It\u2019s just not very pretty at first : When you first open the lid after pressure cooking Chicken Alfredo, it does NOT resemble a creamy, finished product. Trust me, it\u2019ll get there. First, test your chicken and pasta to make sure they\u2019re adequately cooked before doing the final step that taking this dish to the delicious ending. Here\u2019s how\u2026 Confirm 165\u00b0 internal temperature of the chicken : If you choose the cook-whole-shred-later option with the chicken in this recipe, you\u2019ll want to confirm a 165\u00b0 minimum internal temperature of the chicken pieces with a meat thermometer after the cook cycle is complete. Test the pasta for doneness : Before adding parmesan cheese, test the texture of the pasta noodles to make sure they\u2019re to your liking. They should be fully cooked at this point, as in, slightly beyond al dente. But, if you\u2019re the super -soft pasta type, no prob! Just\\xa0return the lid, close the valve, and add another +1 minute to the instant pot (this time with quick pressure release). Bringing it all together : Once you\u2019ve confirmed that the pasta and chicken are adequately cooked, it\u2019s time to stir in the parmesan cheese and the sauce will naturally thicken. If you want it thicker, add more parmesan cheese. If you want it thinner, add more liquid. Not all pasta brands are equal : I\u2019ve definitely found that different brands of pasta noodles produce different results. This is why I recommend testing the noodles for doneness before thickening the sauce with cheese and pressure cook another minute if needed. Grab my easy Instant Pot recipes Alfredo Pasta Storage and Reheat tips The pasta soaks up the sauce : When Chicken Alfredo rests after being cooked, it naturally continues to absorb the moisture of the alfredo sauce and can appear dry. I promise you, it\u2019s not dry. It just needs a splash of cream, chicken broth, or plain water during reheat to revive that glistening creaminess that makes alfredo pasta so irresistible. Freezing alfredo pasta : I\u2019ve never tried it (because\u2026no leftovers lol), therefore I can\u2019t recommend it based on experience. You\u2019re welcome to try\u2026lemme know if you do! Chicken Alfredo Ingredient Substitutions Use ANY milk in place of half and half (add more parm cheese to balance the fat). Use ANY pasta noodles in place of fettuccine. Use shredded chicken , canned chicken, or rotisserie chicken instead of raw chicken breast. You\u2019ll add it at the end when you stir in the cheese and allow it to get warm.

Transfer the chicken to a plate, insert a meat thermometer in the center of the chicken to confirm a minimum internal temperature of 165\u00b0, then allow it to rest for a minute or two. ** See recipe notes below about bringing the chicken up to temperature. Meanwhile, stir the pasta and liquid together. Test a few noodles for doneness. If you\\'re happy, go to the next step. ** See recipe notes below about cooking pasta more. Shred the chicken and add it back to the Instant Pot. Add PARMESAN CHEESE to the pasta, stirring to combine all ingredients. Add more salt and pepper, if needed.

When adding pasta noodles to the cooker, scatter them in multiple directions. Think of it like a bird\u2019s nest where noodles aren\u2019t resting parallel to each other and are touching each other as little as possible. Do I cut the chicken (breast or thighs) into pieces\u2026or not? You can pressure cook the chicken without cutting it first, and then shred it after it has cooked. Or you can cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces before pressure cooking. I prefer to leave it intact during cooking, and shred later. This reduces raw-chicken handling, makes fewer dishes, AND helps prevent drying out. Win-win-win! If the chicken didn\u2019t reach 165\u00b0 after the cycle completes Return the chicken piece(s) to the Instant Pot (with the pasta still in it!), close the lid, close the valve seal, and allow the cooker to sit for 5 minutes. Do not program it to cook. You\u2019ll need to depressurize again and remove all steam before opening the lid. If the pasta isn\u2019t soft enough after the cycle completes If you prefer your pasta really soft, close the lid, close the valve seal, and allow the cooker to sit for 5 minutes. Do not program it to cook. You\u2019ll need to depressurize again and remove all steam before opening the lid.

It cooks fast and keeps us from going hangry. Not really sure why I hear people say to NOT add dairy during pressure cook \u2013 we do it with this alfredo and it works every time! Reply Nicole says 04\/16\/2020 at 1:03 pm Hi! If I was going to just use a jarred alfredo sauce (mixing in at the end) would I up the water instead? Reply The Kitchen Girl says 04\/16\/2020 at 3:13 pm Hi Nicole, that should work just fine, but you may need to drain some water out before adding the sauce at the end.

Classic Chicken Alfredo is a feel good comfort food \u2013 so creamy but light! This post may contain affiliate links. Read my disclosure policy . Mom learned how to make this \u201cPollo Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo\u201d in culinary school. She made it for us when we were kids and we were crazy about it. Now I make the same alfredo recipe for my family. It\u2019s one of my favorite comfort foods. Watch the video tutorial and learn how to make chicken alfredo. Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo Ingredients for Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo: We usually use chicken breast but chicken tenders would work well if that is what you have on hand. Fettuccini is the pasta of choice here but we\u2019ve been known to swap with angel hair or vermicelli. You can use a variety of pastas. P.S. sometimes we sneak in the full pound of pasta when feeding a crowd.\\xa0 Substitute for Half and Half? This recipe calls for half and half, but you can substitute with equal parts of milk and heavy whipping cream. The half and half thickens as it simmers and even more as it rests. If you prefer a creamier or thicker sauce, you can use heavy whipping cream instead.\\xa0 How to Make Chicken Alfredo (Video below): 1. Cook fettuccini in a large pot of salted water (4 qts water with 1 Tbsp salt,) according to package instructions then drain and set aside. 2. Meanwhile, thinly slice chicken breast into strips and season all over with salt and pepper. In a large, deep skillet , heat 2 Tbsp\\xa0olive oil over medium\/high heat and\\xa0saute chicken until light golden and cooked through (5 min). Remove chicken from the pan and cover to keep warm. 3. In the same pan over medium\/high, add 1 Tbsp\\xa0olive oil and 1 Tbsp butter. Add onion and saut\u00e9 3\\xa0minutes until soft. Add sliced mushrooms and saut\u00e9 until soft (5-7 min), stirring\\xa0frequently.\\xa0Add garlic and saut\u00e9 another 30 seconds until fragrant, stirring constantly. 4. Add half-n-half and simmer over medium\/high heat 8-10 min, or until just beginning to thicken. Add chicken back to pan, along with 1\/4 cup parsley and season sauce to taste (1\/2 to 1 tsp salt and 1\/4 tsp pepper). 5. Add cooked pasta and stir to combine. Heat another minute until warmed through then turn off the heat, cover and let pasta rest 10-15 minutes then stir to combine and serve garnished with more parsley. After the pasta rests, you will have a creamy but light Alfredo sauce that coats the noodles perfectly.

I will definitely be making this again in the future. I tried the original recipe with half & half but next time I will be using heavy cream as suggested for a thicker sauce! Thanks Natasha for this recipe! VERY flavorful but not overpowering or too strong. Delicious\\xa0 Reply Natasha\\'s Kitchen April 13, 2020 Hello Christie, what a great compliment from your husband.

We added kale in with the dish to add some green, we cooked in in the pasta water with the pasta. We served with Parmesan cheese on top. We also didn\u2019t add mushrooms.\\xa0 Reply Natashas Kitchen April 6, 2020 Isn\u2019t the flavor amazing for a simple recipe! Thank you for sharing that awesome review!\\xa0 Reply Iman :) April 7, 2020 Hi Natasha! Can\u2019t wait to try your recipe but just one question- how come you don\u2019t add any Italian spices?\\xa0 Reply Natasha\\'s Kitchen April 7, 2020 I\u2019m excited for you to try this out. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t use Italian spices, I just prefer to use simple ingredients that others can easily find.\\xa0 Reply Juan April 6, 2020 I stumbled upon your recipe. It looks really good although I haven\u2019t done it yet. However I wanted to bring to your attention that in the original recipe (in the list of ingredients) it calls for 3\/4 pound of pasta for 8 servings (there\u2019s no way you gonna do 3\/4 lbs for 8 people, unless you are feeding 5 year-olds). 3\/4s is usually for 4 people (even though like you said we can sneak in the full pound), so for 8 people you should aim at 1.5 \u2013 2 lbs of pasta. Just wanted to let you know so you can correct. I really don\u2019t know if the people who said they followed your recipe exactly actually pulled it with 3\/4s while keeping the rest of the ingredients in the same proportions as indicated in the original recipe (8 servings)\\xa0 Reply Natashas Kitchen April 6, 2020 Thank you for sharing that with me, Juan! I\u2019m so glad you found our recipes.\\xa0 Reply Sophia March 29, 2020 This is by far the best chicken fettuccine alfredo recipe I have ever made. I was a little skeptical about adding onions at first because I\u2019ve never used them in Alfredo sauce, but this dish was fantastic! I did use the heavy whipping cream & added a pinch of nutmeg, but other than that, I followed the recipe as is. This will be the only recipe I use from now on. Thank you!\\xa0 Reply Natasha\\'s Kitchen March 29, 2020 That is so great to hear, Sophia Thanks for sharing some tips too!\\xa0 Reply marisa lopez March 28, 2020 I made this tonight and it was amazing! I did substitute the half and half with heavy whipping cream and milk but definitely a new family favorite in my house!\\xa0 Reply Natashas Kitchen March 28, 2020 Thank you so much for sharing that with me. I\u2019m so glad you enjoyed that.\\xa0 Reply Karyn March 21, 2020 Made this tonight for the first time and omg amazing! I\u2019ve made several of your recipes and haven\u2019t had a fail yet! My parents loved it as did I! Another win for Natasha! \\xa0 Reply Natashas Kitchen March 21, 2020 That\u2019s just awesome!! Thank you for sharing your wonderful review, Karyn!\\xa0 Reply Karyn March 21, 2020 You\u2019re welcome! Keep the ge eat recipes coming!\\xa0 Reply Vita March 16, 2020 I forgot half & half, so I subbed 1.5 cups of whole milk w 1.5 TBS butter warmed (so it\u2019s mixed), & a cup of shredded parmesan to into the chicken-onion mixture in the end (slowly) & let it simmer on low med heat. Perfect!!! Added pasta on top & it was so delicious!\\xa0 Reply Natashas Kitchen March 16, 2020 That\u2019s just awesome!! Thank you so much for sharing that with me.\\xa0 Reply Chantel February 24, 2020 Soo yummy! I used heavy whipping cream instead of the half and half then thickened it a tiny bit, definitely saving this one! Love your recipes.\\xa0 Reply Natashas Kitchen February 24, 2020 That\u2019s so great! Thank you for sharing that with me Chantel!\\xa0 Reply Monica February 11, 2020 How much parmesan cheese should be added and when also what kind do you prefer?\\xa0 Reply Natashas Kitchen February 11, 2020 Hi Monica, since it is a lighter sauce (half and half), we serve the finished pasta with freshly grated parmesan cheese which melts over the top when served hot.\\xa0 Reply Svetlana February 2, 2020 Hello Natasha! Can I use a Parmesan cheese in this recipe? Usually Alfredo sous is with Parmesan?!!\\xa0 Reply Natasha\\'s Kitchen February 3, 2020 You sure can.\\xa0 Reply Elena January 29, 2020 I made the chicken Alfredo and followed the directions completely but my sauce never thickened and I even used heavy cream for half of it. Do you have any idea as to what went wrong?\\xa0 Reply Natashas Kitchen January 30, 2020 Hi Elena, it won\u2019t thicken the same way as a heavy whipping cream sauce as it uses light cream (half and half), but it will thicken up slightly and coat the noodles nicely once the heat is turned off and you let it sit for a few minutes. I hope you love it! Also, be sure you are using half and half and not milk.\\xa0 Reply Elena January 28, 2020 I made the chicken Alfredo but my sauce was incredibly liquidity. Any ideas why it didn\u2019t thicken? I followed the recipe directions but I don\u2019t know what went wrong.\\xa0 Reply Natashas Kitchen January 28, 2020 Hi Elena, it won\u2019t thicken the same way as a heavy whipping cream sauce as it uses light cream (half and half), but it will thicken up slightly and coat the noodles nicely once the heat is turned off and you let it sit for a few minutes. I hope you love it! Also, be sure you are using half and half and not milk.\\xa0 Reply Katie January 28, 2020 Hi Natasha Your recipes are really my favorite! Have you ever made this with diced tomatoes or any other veggies? I feel like diced tomatoes would be really good in it! Thanks for all your recipes!\\xa0 Reply Natashas Kitchen January 28, 2020 Hi Katie, I have not tested this with tomato but I bet that could work! This works well with broccoli or spinach added.\\xa0 Reply Mohamad Akhmal March 23, 2020 i put chopped broccoli and carrot along with the pasta. it tastes absolutely nice!\\xa0 Reply Natashas Kitchen March 23, 2020 Yum! Thank you Mohamad!\\xa0 Reply Jeff January 25, 2020 I have never heard of Alfredo sauce without parmesan cheese.\\xa0 Reply natashaskitchen January 25, 2020 Hi Jeff, we add parmesan at the end.\\xa0 Reply BT January 24, 2020 Simple and delicious.\\xa0 Reply Natashas Kitchen January 24, 2020 My favorite kind of recipe! Thank you for stopping by!\\xa0 Reply Yvonne MI Gorans January 20, 2020 Can I cook and make my chicken fetticuini dinner and refrigerate for company dinner the next day? if yes, will I have to add anything so it wont be dry? And what temperature and how long? Also, do I need to cover the dish and oil pan so not to stick. Thank you.\\xa0 Reply Natashas Kitchen January 20, 2020 Hi Yvonne, We prefer it fresh and I believe it is best that way. But it does reheat well.\\xa0 Reply Engie January 15, 2020 Did this tonight and couldn\u2019t be happier with how delish it turned out to be! Thank you so much Natasha for all these great recipes! \\xa0 Reply Natashas Kitchen January 16, 2020 You\u2019re welcome!

I\u2019m so happy you enjoyed it, Matt!\\xa0 Reply Destiny December 23, 2019 Hi Natasha\u2019s, I made this pasta and I loved it and my family too. I do have a question, may I use penne rigate pasta instead of the spaguetti? I want to try it for Christmas, please let me know soon as I will buy the ingredients. Thank you.\\xa0 Reply Natashas Kitchen December 23, 2019 Hi Destine, I haven\u2019t tested that with penne rigate pasta but I imagine that should work! If you experiment please let me know how you like the recipe.\\xa0 Reply Shawn December 3, 2019 I consider myself a good cook. I like to try new recipes and experiment but\u2026i have never\u2026.ever\u2026made alfredo! Can you believe this? I gotta tell ya Natasha, this recipe is legit. So easy and delicious.

Thank you for that great review.\\xa0 Reply Natascha Bettaieb November 27, 2019 Hi Natasha. I\u2019m from Switzerland and I LOVE your recipes. As your Family is also from europe I wanted to ask if you can tell me what I can use instead of half and half (it doesn\u2019t exist here). Lots of love Natascha\\xa0 Reply natashaskitchen November 27, 2019 Hi Natascha, half and half is the same thing as equal parts of heavy whipping cream and milk. So use 1 3\/4 cup of each to make half and half. You could also use heavy cream for the sauce and thin it out to taste with milk.\\xa0 Reply Kathy Eshnaur November 26, 2019 Sauce never thickened. Half and half just doesnt do it. Adding Parmesan would have added to flavor.\\xa0 Reply Natashas Kitchen November 27, 2019 Hi Kathy, it won\u2019t thicken the same way as a heavy whipping cream sauce as it uses light cream (half and half), but it will thicken up slightly and coat the noodles nicely once the heat is turned off and you let it sit for a few minutes. I hope you love it! Also, be sure you are using half and half and not milk.\\xa0 Reply Gussie Wilson November 6, 2019 Delicious! This made a lot more than I thought! Can I freeze some?\\xa0 Reply Natashas Kitchen November 6, 2019 To be honest I haven\u2019t tried freezing it but I think it might work. I\u2019d add a little bit more cream or half and half when re-heating to make sure it isn\u2019t dry\\xa0 Reply Posi November 4, 2019 Hi Natasha Thanks so much for your great recipes I followed this one but the sauce curdled can you please tell me why did everything as the video\\xa0 Reply Natashas Kitchen November 4, 2019 Hi Posi, I haven\u2019t had that happen but I\u2019m more than happy to troubleshoot.

I was just wondering if I can substitute the half and half for a different milk alternative such as almond milk or almond cream? Thank you.\\xa0 Reply Natashas Kitchen October 18, 2019 Hi Jenny, I really haven\u2019t tested anything else with this recipe that is dairy free. One of my readers recently mentioned that they use the cream from canned coconut milk to make my zuppa toscana soup recipe creamy without using milk cream, but I haven\u2019t tested that here so it\u2019s hard to recommend it here. The almond milk would not be thick enough on it\u2019s own but it may work if you add 3 Tbsp of flour after the mushrooms are cooked and saut\u00e9 the mushrooms with the flour for a couple minutes until golden then slowly add about 2 to 2 1\/2 cups almond milk and bring to a simmer, whisking until it thickens. I haven\u2019t tried this method myself but I\u2019ve seen it done online. Sorry I can\u2019t be more helpful \u2013 that\u2019s my best guess!\\xa0 Reply Jenny October 20, 2019 Hi Natasha! I just want to give you an update on making this delicious chicken alfredo with almond milk and it turned out really good!! The only thing is for me is that I would recommend unsweetened almond milk so that it doesn\u2019t bring out any sweet flavours and add more milk to make it more saucey. But otherwise, very good!!\\xa0 Reply Natashas Kitchen October 20, 2019 I\u2019m glad you enjoyed that, Jenny! Thank you for sharing that recommendation with us.\\xa0 Reply Janine November 9, 2019 I\u2019ve never heard of Alfredo sauce without any kind of cheese! Wouldn\u2019t this be good with some Romano and parmesan? Natashas Kitchen November 9, 2019 Hi Janine, you are welcome to add cheese but it does get pretty creamy with out that. Barbara Sparnell October 17, 2019 Made this for dinner tonight, first time not incorporating parmesan in the recipe and I have to say it was better. My family absolutely loved it and adding the parmesan at the table worked just fine. Definitely will be on our rotation. Thanks Natasha!!! Oh, and for dessert, we had your pumpkin cake and it was fantastic! A+ Next time I\u2019ll take pics.\\xa0 Reply Natashas Kitchen October 17, 2019 I\u2019m so happy to hear that! Thank you for sharing your great review and feedback, barbara!\\xa0 Reply K October 16, 2019 Not the best. Definitely didn\u2019t thicken like a normal Alfredo sauce. I also added Parmesan for flavor. It was okay but I\u2019ll probably try a different recipe next time\\xa0 Reply natashaskitchen October 17, 2019 Hi K, this is a lighter alfredo sauce as it uses half and half or light cream. You can replace it with heavy whipping cream if you prefer a thicker sauce. I would also highly recommend our chicken in lemon cream sauce or our shrimp alfredo both of which have the rich cream sauce you might be looking for.\\xa0 Reply Richard October 15, 2019 Hello Natasha, thanks for the delicious recipes, I love your site! I\u2019m not a mushroom fan. Is there another flavorful substitute? I saw one comment where broccoli was used. Any other suggestions?

I substituted the mushrooms with broccoli and I also added a chicken bullion cube while saut\u00e9ing the chicken in addition to the salt and pepper. Yummy!!!

It was the first (and last) Alfredo sauce I\u2019ve ever made and has become a major fav! It was very tasty as original recipe but have since expanded with adding fresh grated Parmesan cheese to simmering equal parts half & half with heavy cream, adding different veggies. No doubt a winner for any level cooking experience.\\xa0 Reply Natashas Kitchen September 17, 2019 Aww that\u2019s the best! Thank you so much for sharing that with me!\\xa0 Reply Brett February 1, 2020 Not the greatest not the worst. Definitely Thin, if you want thicker add parmesan cheese during the cooking process. Needed a little more flavor, and top with fresh cut tomatoes to bring it together.\\xa0 Reply Natashas Kitchen February 1, 2020 Hi Brett, thank you for your feedback with us!\\xa0 Reply Christina September 17, 2019 This is definitely a plate of happiness! I used heavy whipping cream and half and half and the sauce was perfect! Thickened up beautifully. Thank you, Natasha for a wonderful recipe!\\xa0 Reply Natashas Kitchen September 17, 2019 That sounds amazing! Thank you for that great feedback, Christina!\\xa0 Reply Melanie September 12, 2019 It\u2019s not Alfredo sauce without Parmesan. This is a plate of sadness.\\xa0 Reply natashaskitchen September 12, 2019 Hi Melanie, with a half and half (lighter sauce), the parmesan is more likely to clump up. We serve it over the top here. Also, in all the years we have loved this, we have never experienced sadness while enjoying this.\\xa0 Reply Luba October 15, 2019 This is the best!!!\\xa0 Reply Natashas Kitchen October 15, 2019 I\u2019m so happy you enjoyed that, Luba!\\xa0 Reply Sherrie December 31, 2019 I love this response Natasha.

Why no Parm?\\xa0 Reply natashaskitchen August 22, 2019 Hi Lloyd, because this is a lighter sauce, it doesn\u2019t incorporate easily so we always add it as garnish over the finished dish. If you prefer a traditional alfredo sauce, you should try our shrimp alfredo or lemon chicken pasta. \\xa0 Reply cj parody August 20, 2019 Natasha ,love most of your recipes(my tastes not your fault) but one thing I have never had any training in and struggle with at home (getting better) is pizza dough no matter how i try I can\u2019t get it to roll out without shrinking back so my calzones,pizza rolls pizza,ect. are always miss shaped or leak out ingrediants. any video,suggestions or help for a new fan.\\xa0 Reply natashaskitchen August 20, 2019 Hi CJ, I have had several requests for pizza dough and it is on my list.

I don\u2019t like mushrooms so just pick out but know most people don\u2019t want to be bothered. those who have kids that don\u2019t like onion or other veggies try green onion added near end when mixed less strong. also peas broccoli,spinach or carrots if they like any of these.i have even used asparagus and snap peas with chicken and shrimp versions.\\xa0 Reply Natashas Kitchen August 20, 2019 Thank you so much for sharing that with us CJ.\\xa0 Reply Natashas Kitchen August 20, 2019 Thank you for sharing those tips with us CJ!\\xa0 Reply Linda August 14, 2019 Excellent!

Whipping cream has slightly less fat than heavy cream but it will still work well.\\xa0 Reply Harry July 20, 2019 This was sooooo good. I think the key is leaving the Fettuinci in the pan covered for about 10 minutes. I followed the directions to the letter only adding frozen peas when I added the chicken. I also put in a tablespoon of lemon juice before I put the lid on. To those complaining\/ whining that the recipe didn\u2019t mention Parmesan cheese? Oh grow up! Doesn\u2019t that addition go without saying? It\u2019s a great recipe, the best chicken fettuccini recipe I ever tried\\xa0 Reply Natashas Kitchen July 20, 2019 Thank you so much for sharing that with us Harry!\\xa0 Reply CJ Parody August 20, 2019 Love your recipes ,but as someone cooking for a living for over 30 yrs I would like to address some of Harrys points, first no need to be rude while telling others to grow up since technically they are right no cheese is just a white\/cream sauce. 2nd about the cheese not everyone is a cook some may be kids ,from other countries or just starting out so being vague which a lot of recipe sites do is going to get questions when all steps(adding cheese on top) are not mentioned.even I ask when cooking stuff not familiar or trying new ways and steps are omitted. I am glad that you do answer when asked especially when not everyone is like me who at home likes to experiment and make things by sight and taste when able.\\xa0 Reply Carter June 25, 2019 This was SO needed for a pasta craving. I added a teaspoon of corn starch for a little extra thickness which was great. I also used zucchini noodles and dried them out on paper towels to drain. Don\u2019t cook the zoodles into the pasta.

One question, we see you using your Cuisinart counter top burner allot. Is this the CB-30 model and how do you like it? Any issues? I\u2019m thinking of purchasing one. Thankyou\\xa0 Reply natashaskitchen March 7, 2019 Hi Pete, it\u2019s nice to have an extra burner if you are tight on space on your stove. I still prefer my gas cooktop stove because I have better heat control, but this does the job for easier filming (which is the primary reason why we purchased it). It takes a little bit to warm it up and if you overheat, it cools down slowly so be aware of that but I think it\u2019s the same for all of these little cooktops unless they are induction cooktops.\\xa0 Reply Celina Nagra February 27, 2019 Hi! I made this but even after simmering the sauce for so long it just wouldn\u2019t thicken up.. not sure what went wrong!\\xa0 Reply natashaskitchen February 27, 2019 Hi Celina, it won\u2019t thicken the same way as a heavy whipping cream sauce as it uses light cream (half and half), but it will thicken up slightly and coat the noodles nicely once the heat is turned off and you let it sit for a few minutes. I hope you love it! Also, be sure you are using half and half and not milk.\\xa0 Reply asha February 22, 2019 Its sooooo good. Soooo delicious. I made for my dinner tonight. Thanks Natasha.

When using a light cream (half and half), it is important to simmer the sauce until it thickens slightly or it will be too loose and won\u2019t coat the noodles easily.\\xa0 Reply Mary Keahey February 10, 2019 I made this with a few modifications to make it healthier. I had never made Alfredo sauce before and it turned out great. I didn\u2019t have all the ingredients so I used spinach fettuccine, majority milk, plus half and half and cream. I also added green peas to make it a one dish meal. Very good!!\\xa0 Reply Natashas Kitchen February 11, 2019 That sounds lovely, Mary! Thank you for that wonderful review!!!\\xa0 Reply Mel February 3, 2019 Does the sauce have to be used immediately? Looking to make it ahead and add chicken later?\\xa0 Reply Natashas Kitchen February 3, 2019 Hi Mel, We like it fresh and I believe it is best that way. But it does reheat well.\\xa0 Reply Kevin January 20, 2019 Some parts are a little vague. Lots of liquid when chicken is cooked. I assume you drain?? Also lot of liquid from saut\u00e9ed mushrooms. I assume you leave in? Has a good taste but a little on the bland side. Definitely needs some Parmesan and extra pepper. Maybe white pepper.\\xa0 Reply natashaskitchen January 21, 2019 Hi Kevin, I am always happy to help troubleshoot. It could be bland if there was extra liquid in the pan. Frozen chicken can give off liquid especially if you cook it and it isn\u2019t fully thawed. You would definitely want to thaw first and if you end up with liquid after cooking chicken, drain that before proceeding. Also, with mushrooms, when you sautee \u2013 in order to get a browning on the mushrooms, they will release liquid which evaporates and then they will properly brown. Hope that helps and you can add parmesan and season to taste at the end.\\xa0 Reply David January 29, 2019 Omg Natasha! thanks for taking the time to answer the thing about the chicken. I attempted this recipe twice so far, and both times I was wondering why the pan got so liquidy, and why the mushrooms I cook look nothing like what is shown in your video. I\u2019m going to attempt this again and drain the pan after cooking the chicken! hopefully I see results!\\xa0 Reply Natashas Kitchen January 29, 2019 You\u2019re so welcome, David!\\xa0 Reply Leslie December 29, 2019 Hi Natasha.

When my son tasted it before the parm, he said it was just a bechamel sauce and while good, it wasn\u2019t Alfredo. I added a cup of freshly grated parm and it went from delicious to spectacular. I now have a house full of people talking about how good it is. I had a group of people who aren\u2019t fond of mushrooms and I KNOW it is because they haven\u2019t had a well cooked mushroom. I diced them medium fine and cook them for about an hour over a low light with some butter and olive oil with a splash of soy sauce after 30 minutes.. They become crispy, super concentrated in flavor and amazing as a topper\u2026so EVERY mushroom hater has put THOSE mushrooms on their pasta.\\xa0 Reply Natashas Kitchen December 3, 2018 That\u2019s just awesome!!

Grandma of 10\\xa0 Reply natashaskitchen October 2, 2018 Hi Julie, that should work fine but keep in mind you would probably need 2 pans to cook the sauce or it would take a long time for the sauce to thicken up slightly making a double batch. To speed up the process, you could replace some of the half and half with heavy whipping cream.\\xa0 Reply Ella Eats September 28, 2018 This recipe was amazing and super easy for prep and clean up!

Cooking is a great way to get the little ones to eat their veggies, but you may have to get creative, finely chop the mushrooms, and if you have to, grate the onion (can\u2019t see much onion, but great flavor, and nutrients).\\xa0 Reply Natashas Kitchen August 14, 2018 Yes! Thank you Lee!\\xa0 Reply Erin September 20, 2018 Hi Katie, I\u2019m not a fan of onions either, so I dice it up into extremely tiny pieces to get the flavour without having to see myself eating it. You can try using peas (if they don\u2019t mind it), or adding fresh herbs like thyme in. It\u2019s not an alfredo anymore, but at least there\u2019s a bit more than just one note.\\xa0 Reply Natashas Kitchen September 20, 2018 Thank you for your great ideas, Erin!\\xa0 Reply Dakota N. August 10, 2018 One of the first meals my fiance ever made me when we were dating was Fettuccine Alfredo. Tomorrow is our one year anniversary and he requested a dinner of Fettuccine Alfredo to celebrate\u2026 I had never made it before. So I spent all day today searching for a recipie to try. Landed on this one and decided to give it a try. I made it exactly to the recipie, except I added one cup of finely shredded parmesan cheese before I added the chicken and parsley at the end. It turned out AAMMAAZZIINNGG. My fiance said it\u2019s even better than the one he makes! We both are until we were bursting, and we still have 4 full servings left. I\u2019ll definitely come back to this recipie every time. Thank you!!\\xa0 Reply Natashas Kitchen August 11, 2018 That\u2019s so great Dakota! I\u2019m so happy you discovered our blog and found this recipe! Thank you for the wonderful review!\\xa0 Reply Anna August 10, 2018 Great recipe!! I didn\u2019t have enough half n half so in place of some of it i mixed some chicken bouillon with corn starch to help thicken it a bit and it came out plenty creamy. Also, next time I will double the garlic.\\xa0 Reply Natashas Kitchen August 10, 2018 Anna that\u2019s a great idea! Thank you for sharing that with us!\\xa0 Reply Brandon February 14, 2019 Made it, and was really good. I just would like to know how to make the alfredo more creamy\\xa0 Reply Natashas Kitchen February 14, 2019 If you would like the sauce to be thicker, I would suggest simmering it a little longer. The sauce isn\u2019t as creamy as an alfredo made with heavy whipping cream \u2013 it is a lighter sauce but it should still coat the noodles. Cooking the sauce a little longer should help \ud83d\ude42 also, some of our readers chose to finish it with parmesan cheese for more creamy texture.\\xa0 Reply Z August 9, 2018 Hi Natasha! That looks delicious! (P.S. I saw that your little princess made a cameo appearance in the video. She looks so pretty!)\\xa0 Reply Natashas Kitchen August 9, 2018 She sure did!

I will have to give this a try a well and will report back with results \ud83d\ude42\\xa0 Reply Natashas Kitchen August 9, 2018 That is an interesting idea! Yes I would love to know!\\xa0 Reply Dyana August 8, 2018 Thank you for sharing such a simple but delicious recipe!! \ud83d\ude04 I substituted the half and half with milk and heavy cream mixture, and I omitted the mushrooms because I didn\u2019t have them on hand, but it still turned out great! For those who mentioned that the sauce is too runny, try simmering it for a couple minutes longer before adding the chicken and pasta. It worked for me! My husband liked that it has some sauce to it and he couldn\u2019t believe me when I said I didn\u2019t use any cheese in this recipe LOL! This recipe is definitely a keeper \ud83d\ude01 Thanks, Natasha!! \u2764\\xa0 Reply Natashas Kitchen August 8, 2018 Thank you so much for sharing your tips with us Dyana!

You might try the proportions of our creamy shrimp pasta instead which uses heavy whipping cream. I\u2019m assuming you are referring to heavy whipping cream.\\xa0 Reply Alex J September 15, 2017 I love this recipe, it works amazing. The only problem I have is sometimes the half and half doesn\u2019t seem to thicken up, and the dish seems slightly wet. I\u2019m probably doing something wrong, but any suggestions I\u2019d appreciate\\xa0 Reply natashaskitchen September 15, 2017 Hi Alex, If you would like the sauce to be thicker, I would suggest simmering it a little longer.

Never heard of that before. I\u2019ve seen and made alfredo without cream\u2026but no parmesan??? Huh\u2026.not sure you can call it alfredo.\\xa0 Reply natashaskitchen July 22, 2017 Hi JS, My Mother learned this version in culinary school and parmesan or not, it is really good! \ud83d\ude42 You can definitely add parmesan if you prefer but this is a lighter alfredo sauce and it has enough flavor without it.\\xa0 Reply Sarah Beth July 10, 2017 Hi Natasha! We really enjoyed this recipe, however, the sauce really didn\u2019t thicken. It came out runny. The flavors were yummy and my two year old ate it all up( how can I complain about that?!). I followed the recipe though so I\u2019m really not sure what happened.\\xa0 Reply natashaskitchen July 10, 2017 Hi Sarah, I would suggest cooking it slightly longer \u2013 maybe yours was over lower heat? Also, the sauce does thicken up more as it stands. It isn\u2019t supposed to be a heavy\/thick sauce like my shrimp alfredo .

I usually use his almond milk when cooking, but don\u2019t believe that it would be thick enough for this.\\xa0 Reply natashaskitchen April 3, 2017 Hi Karen, I really haven\u2019t tested anything else with this recipe that is dairy free. One of my readers recently mentioned that they use the cream from canned coconut milk to make my zuppa toscana soup recipe creamy without using milk cream, but I haven\u2019t tested that here so it\u2019s hard to recommend it here. The almond milk would not be thick enough on it\u2019s own but it may work if you add 3 Tbsp of flour after the mushrooms are cooked and saut\u00e9 the mushrooms with the flour for a couple minutes until golden then slowly add about 2 to 2 1\/2 cups almond milk and bring to a simmer, whisking until it thickens. I haven\u2019t tried this method myself but I\u2019ve seen it done online. Sorry I can\u2019t be more helpful \u2013 that\u2019s my best guess! \ud83d\ude42\\xa0 Reply Karen April 3, 2017 Okay, thanks.

The cream definitely beats the canned Alfredo sauce I used to buy at the store. I also really like how you give credit to your friends for the recipes.\\xa0 Reply Irina December 21, 2011 Hi Natasha. So how creamy exactly is the sauce supposed to get? Mine was still kind of runny even after I let it cool down a bit. Maybe this recipe would be better with heavy whipping cream instead of half & half. It would probably be much richer and more calories of course \ud83d\ude09 Thanks.\\xa0 Reply natashaskitchen December 21, 2011 It may have needed a couple more minutes of cooking. I\u2019ll have to post a heavy whipping cream version one of these days (I am a sucker for creamy pastas). This is definitely a lighter version but a little trickier in terms of cooking time.\\xa0 Reply Irina December 24, 2011 I love creamy pasta also \ud83d\ude09 But this one wasn\u2019t too creamy for me, so next time will definitely try it with whipping cream instead. Still a wonderful recipe. Thank you!\\xa0 Reply Lena March 16, 2013 Well, it\u2019s says half and half in the recipe, but you have heavy whipping cream in the picture.\\xa0 Reply natashaskitchen March 16, 2013 Sorry I added that little tid-bit to the instructions; you can use either half and half or equal parts milk and heavy whipping cream. Tamara December 13, 2011 How much salt to you add to the water you cook the pasta in? My cousin works at an Italian restaurant and says you have to make the water almost as salty as salt water.\\xa0 Reply natashaskitchen December 14, 2011 It depends on the type of pot you use. In a medium pot, I would use 1 to 1 1\/2 tsp salt. In a large pot, I\u2019d use closer to a tbsp.\\xa0 Reply Dina August 19, 2011 I made this yesterday and it turned out delishious. My husbend esp. like the creamy mushroom taste. I loved it too, but I must admit I felt a little guilty eating it, since it\u2019s pretty rich.

Melt 2 tablespoons butter, add 2 tablespoons flour then cook over low heat and whisk in the milk slowly so there are not clumps, then add to recipe \ud83d\ude42\\xa0 Reply natashaskitchen November 7, 2012 Anna; thanks for the tip!\\xa0 Reply Add comment\/review Leave a comment Cancel reply Recipe Rating Comment Name * Email * Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

Please read my disclosure policy . My favorite recipe for homemade Alfredo sauce.\\xa0 It\u2019s easy to make in just 15 minutes, full of the best creamy and garlicky flavors, and always ultra comforting and delicious. After sharing my favorite marinara sauce recipe with you yesterday, today I\u2019m sharing my go-to recipe for its creamy, cheesy, ultra-comforting counterpart\u2026 \u2026my favorite homemade Alfredo sauce. \u2661 Now I will be the first to note that this Alfredo sauce recipe is \u201cAmerican-style,\u201d a la the Olive Garden version that zillions of us grew up loving.\\xa0 By contrast to its Italian-style origins, in which the sauce was created in Rome with just butter and cheese (more similar to my cacio e pepe recipe ), American-style Alfredo sauce is famously a bit more indulgent and complex.\\xa0 Heavy cream and\/or milk are typically added to make the sauce creamier, differing levels of flour are added to create a roux and make the sauce thicker, and a number of different seasonings are often added (especially a hint of white pepper and nutmeg) to give it an extra flavor boost.\\xa0 So while this may come as a surprise to some, the American-style version of this sauce would definitely not be considered authentic in Italy.\\xa0 But hey, I think we can all agree that the creamy version of this sauce has become an iconic favorite of its own. \u2661 That said, though, all American-style Alfredo sauce recipes are\\xa0 definitely not created alike!\\xa0 I don\u2019t know about you guys, but I have been served far too many Alfredos over the years that were gloppy and greasy and devoid of good flavor, which simply will not do.\\xa0 (Especially when indulging in a cream sauce\u2026I want it to be amazing!)\\xa0 So today, I\u2019m sharing my favorite homemade Alfredo recipe that I have tweaked over the years to perfection. My version is made with a base of half milk and half cream, so that it\u2019s still rich and creamy but not overly heavy.\\xa0 It\u2019s seasoned with plenty of garlic plus a hint of white pepper and nutmeg, all of which serve to balance out those creamy flavors nicely.\\xa0 It\u2019s just slightly thickened with a tablespoon of flour, which you are also welcome to leave out entirely if you prefer.\\xa0 And best of all, it\u2019s made with lots and lots of freshly-grated Parmesan, which is really the main flavor we all want and love in a good Alfredo. Oh and bonus?\\xa0 The entire recipe is incredibly easy to make and comes together in just 15 minutes.\\xa0 And, of course, it tastes a million times better than anything that you can buy in a jar.\\xa0 Perfect for tossing with pasta, topping grilled chicken, spreading as a white pizza sauce, mixing into lasagna and baked ziti, or whatever else sounds good. I\u2019m telling you, this Alfredo sauce is always a winner.\\xa0 So let\u2019s make some! Alfredo Sauce Recipe | 1-Minute Video Homemade Alfredo Sauce Ingredients: To make this American-style Alfredo sauce recipe, you will need the following ingredients: Butter:\\xa0 Or you could also substitute olive oil, if you prefer. Garlic:\\xa0 Finely-minced or pressed. All-purpose flour:\\xa0 To help form a roux and thicken the sauce.\\xa0 If you are making gluten-free Alfredo sauce, however, you are welcome to omit the flour and have a slightly thinner sauce.\\xa0 Or you can use a cornstarch slurry to thicken it (see details below). Heavy cream and milk:\\xa0 We will use this blend as the base for our sauce. Parmesan cheese:\\xa0 I recommend freshly-grating your Parmesan cheese so that it will melt more smoothly into the sauce.\\xa0 Also, grated Parmesan cheese can be tricky to measure correctly simply with a measuring cup, so I recommend using a kitchen scale if you own one. Sea salt and white pepper :\\xa0 I like to use fine sea salt and white pepper to season this sauce.\\xa0 If you are new to cooking with white pepper, please note that it has a slightly different flavor and is significantly more potent than black pepper, so you do not need to use as much.\\xa0 That said, if you only have black pepper in the house, that will work too. Ground nutmeg : \\xa0A pinch of nutmeg is typically used in American-style Alfredo, but you can omit this if you prefer. How To Make Alfredo Sauce: Alright, let\u2019s talk about how to make Alfredo sauce!\\xa0 Simply\u2026 Saut\u00e9 garlic.\\xa0 Briefly saut\u00e9 the garlic in butter until it is lightly golden (be sure not to overcook it).\\xa0 Then stir in some flour to form a roux. Add the milk and cream.\\xa0\\xa0 And whisk until evenly combined. Simmer. Continue cooking the sauce until it reaches a simmer, then reduce heat to maintain the simmer, add in the Parmesan, salt, white pepper and nutmeg, and whisk until the cheese is completely melted and the sauce is smooth. Season. Don\u2019t forget to taste and season with extra salt and\/or white pepper, if needed. Serve.\\xa0\\xa0 And\u2026enjoy!\\xa0 So simple, right?! Possible Recipe Variations: There are all sorts of ways that you can customize this basic Alfredo sauce recipe, so feel free to experiment and get creative!\\xa0 Here are a few of my favorite variations\u2026 Make it gluten-free:\\xa0 To make gluten-free Alfredo sauce, just omit the flour (and have a slightly thinner sauce).\\xa0 Or, you can omit the flour and use a cornstarch slurry (equal parts cold water and cornstarch, added to the sauce as it is simmering) to thicken the sauce. Make it lighter: To make a lighter Alfredo sauce, use milk in place of heavy cream (so 2 cups of milk total, no cream). Make it extra-garlicky:\\xa0 If you want to make your sauce extra-garlicky, feel free to double the amount of garlic cloves. Use roasted garlic: If you want even more complex garlic flavors in the sauce, skip the minced garlic and instead roast an entire head of garlic and stir the cloves into the sauce to make a delicious roasted garlic Alfredo sauce. Add Cajun seasoning:\\xa0 To make Cajun Alfredo sauce, stir your desired amount of Cajun seasoning (I recommend 2 to 4 teaspoons, to taste) into the sauce. Add pesto:\\xa0 If you happen to have some basil pesto on hand, try stirring in a few tablespoons to make a delicious pesto Alfredo sauce. Ways To Use Alfredo Sauce: There are endless ways that you can put this Alfredo sauce recipe to delicious use!\\xa0 For example, feel free to make\u2026 Alfredo Pasta: Fettuccine Alfredo is obviously the most famous option here, but any shape of pasta will do.\\xa0 To make traditional fettuccine Alfredo, cook 1 pound of fettuccine until al dente, drain, then toss with the Alfredo sauce until combined.\\xa0 Feel free to add in cooked proteins of your choice (for example, to make chicken Alfredo pasta, shrimp Alfredo, or meatballs Alfredo).\\xa0 And of course, veggies such as broccoli, mushrooms, asparagus and more are delicious additions too! Homemade Pasta Option: Or, if you really want to kick your Alfredo pasta up a notch, try making it with homemade pasta! One batch of this sauce will pair perfectly with one batch of my favorite homemade pasta recipe . Alfredo Pizza:\\xa0 Use this sauce in place of marinara pizza sauce. Alfredo Dip:\\xa0 Use this sauce as a dip for breadsticks, veggie sticks, pretzels and more. Alfredo Casserole:\\xa0 I also love using this recipe as a sauce in casseroles , baked ziti and white lasagna.

Could\u2019ve used this last week but will be making the same dish again \u2013 alfredo + squash (or pumpkin or sweet potato). Also, was just perusing old recipes for ideas of ways to use my pantry items and saw that you used to do Mailbox Mondays where you answered questions from readers. Can this come back please?! Kathy \u2014 April 8, 2020 @ 11:18 am Reply Why not use half and half instead of cream and milk? Ali \u2014 April 8, 2020 @ 12:26 pm That works too! Half and half can be difficult to find in some countries, so I just went with half cream and half milk. :) Beth Wilson \u2014 April 8, 2020 @ 11:21 am Reply Hi, Can we use half and half, in lieu of the heavy cream? Unfortunately, organic (which is my choice) heavy cream, contains nasty fillers or stabilizers. The organic half & half, does not. Thanks! And that looks delicious. Beth Ali \u2014 April 8, 2020 @ 12:25 pm Sure thing, that should work well. Enjoy! :) Digna \u2014 April 8, 2020 @ 1:12 pm Reply Ali, I made Alfredo sauce a couple of weeks ago \u2013 similar recipe that I altered quite a bit. It was loved by my husband and adult grandson, my taste team and best critics. I didn\u2019t have cream so used only 1\/2&1\/2 but will be trying your version this week. Our nice April weather turned dreary suddenly with rain and even light snow this morning, so it\u2019ll be a perfect dinner tonight. I depend on your recipes to keep my meals varied and different. Jennifer \u2014 April 10, 2020 @ 2:25 am Reply We loved this sauce!!! \u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u2605 Wendy \u2014 April 13, 2020 @ 8:02 am Reply Ali, I have loved every recipe of yours I\u2019ve made, but this Alfredo recipe stands alone atop the podium (very, very close to your pork carnitas, which was first til now!). I used your sauce as a base for a tossed chicken and spinach penne, and I wanted to dive into a pool of the sauce. So delicious! Thank you for sharing your culinary creativity and talent. Julia \u2014 April 16, 2020 @ 7:04 pm Reply This was delicious! I used 2% milk and half &half because that\u2019s what I had. So quick, the sauce was done before the pasta! Will be making this a lot in the future. \u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u00ab Previous Post Next Post \u00bb Hey, I\u2019m Ali! My favorite thing in life is time spent around the table.
