It can be made from whole wheat flour or all purpose flour. Usually noodles are cooked al dente, but for some recipes I prefer to cook them till they are softened, since I do not cook them further after mixing with veggies.\nThe method listed here will give you non sticky noodles that can be used in any noodle recipes like Hakka noodles , Schezwan noodles , Chow mein \u00a0and\u00a0 Chilli garlic noodles .\nSome Indo Chinese recipes are made with fried noodles as one of the main ingredients. E.g Chinese bhel and American chopsuey . for such recipes you can check this detailed Recipe post on how to fry noodles .\nStepwise method for making non sticky boiled noodles\n1. Heat 5 to 6 cups water in a pan.\n2. Bring the water to a boil.\n3.\u00a0then add \u00bd teaspoon salt.\n4. Next add \u00bd teaspoon oil. Mix well.\n5. Then add 150 grams noodles.\n6. Boil the noodles on medium to high flame till they are cooked well.\n7. Check the doneness of noodles by pressing a few noodles or tasting them. They should be softened. You can even cook the noodles till al dente if you plan to stir fry the noodles for some more minutes later. For an al dente texture, there will be a slight bite in the cooked noodles. Do note that not to over cook the noodles. They will end up becoming sticky and\u00a0lumpy.\n8. Once the noodles are cooked well, drain them in a colander or sieve.\n9.

If you want you can even drizzle 1 to 2 teaspoons of oil and mix it gently with the noodles.\n11.

This recipe of Chinese bhel is too delicious and tastes exactly like a street style chaat snack.\nGet My Secrets to Great Indian Food\nSign up for my FREE Beginners Guide to Delicious Indian Cooking\nIn Chinese bhel, fried crispy noodles are used with stir fried veggies and a few sauces. When I make Chinese bhel I prefer to use sweet tamarind chutney as it gives a really nice sour and sweet taste in the bhel.\nTo make this bhel you need to use three different types of sauces or chutneys \u2013 a spicy sauce, a sweet sauce and a tangy or sour sauce. You can even use green chutney or red chili chutney\u00a0or schezwan sauce.\nTo make Chinese bhel\nThe sauces I have used are soy sauce (naturally fermented), sweet tamarind chutney and sriracha sauce. Instead of sriracha sauce you can use red chilli sauce or sweet chilli sauce. Instead of sweet tamarind chutney you can use tomato ketchup. In fact you can use a combination of your favorite sauces.\nYou can add veggies of your choice.

So once in a while if you make then its fine when the kids ask for it.

Stir the corn flour paste (as the corn flour settles down) and then add slowly in a stream in the pan.\n41. As soon as you add corn flour paste, quickly stir so that lumps are not formed. In case lumps do form, then use a wired whisk and stir the gravy (sauce).\n42. Season with salt as per taste. Add less salt as the sauces already have salt in them.\n43. Add \u00bc teaspoon black pepper powder or crushed black pepper. Mix very well.\n44. Simmer on a low to medium flame for 2 to 3 minutes till the sauce thicken. Check the taste and the corn flour\u2019s raw taste should not be there.\n45. Now add 1 teaspoon rice vinegar or apple cider vinegar or white vinegar. You can also add lemon juice in place of vinegar. Add \u00bd to 1 teaspoon lemon juice.\n46. Add \u00bd to 1 teaspoon sugar. You can add less or more sugar as required.

If they come up too quickly then the oil is very hot, so the flame need to be reduced.\nAdd noodles in batches.\nAs soon as you add noodles, then with a slotted spoon separate them.\nFry till the base become light golden and crisp.\nThen turn over and fry the second side till crisp and light golden.\nTurn over a couple of times and fry till the noodles become golden.\nRemove fried noodles with a slotted spoon draining excess oil in the kadai or pan.\nPlace fried noodles on kitchen paper towels so that extra oil is absorbed. This way fry the noodles in batches.\u00a0\nOnce cooled, then place the crispy fried noodles in an air-tight container.\npreparation to make chopsuey sauce\nShred or finely chop the veggies. You can use a food processor or chop the veggies with a knife.\u00a0\nIn a small bowl, take 3 tablespoons tomato ketchup, 1 tablespoon soy sauce and \u00bd tablespoon sweet red chilli sauce or sriracha sauce.\nMix the three sauces very well with a spoon.\nIn another small bowl take 2 tablespoons corn flour and 2 tablespoons water.\u00a0mix very well.\nmaking chopsuey sauce\nHeat 1 tablespoon sesame oil in a wok or kadai or a pan. You can also use peanut oil or sunflower oil. Keep the flame to low to medium.\nAdd \u00bd teaspoon finely chopped ginger and \u00bd teaspoon finely chopped garlic.\nSaute for some seconds till the raw aroma of both ginger and garlic goes away.\nNow add \u00bc cup chopped spring onions.\u00a0\nIncrease the heat to medium or high and stir fry onions for a minute.\nNow add the shredded veggies.\u00a0mix very well.\nStir fry vegetables on medium to high flame for 4 to 5 minutes.\nNow reduce the flame and add the sauces.\u00a0mix very well with the stir fried veggies.\nAdd 1.5 to 1.75 cups water and mix well.\nStir the corn flour paste (as the corn flour settles down) and then add slowly in a stream in the pan.\nAs soon as you add corn flour paste, quickly stir so that lumps are not formed. In case lumps do form, then use a wired whisk and stir the gravy (sauce).\nSeason with salt as per taste. Add less salt as the sauces already have salt in them.\nAdd \u00bc teaspoon black pepper powder or crushed black pepper. Mix very well.\nSimmer on a low to medium flame for 2 to 3 minutes till the sauce thickens. Check the taste and the corn flour's raw taste should not be there.\nNow add 1 teaspoon rice vinegar or apple cider vinegar or white vinegar.\nAdd \u00bd to 1 teaspoon sugar. You can add less or more sugar as required. Check the taste before adding sugar and if required then only add sugar. Mix very well.\nSwitch off the flame and now add 2 tablespoons spring onion greens.\nMix well. The chop suey sauce is ready to be served. Check the final taste and add salt, sugar, black pepper, soy sauce or any of the sauces if required.\nmaking american chopsuey\nNow break the fried noodles and take them in 2 to 3 serving plates or bowls. I usually break the fried noodles. You can even keep them as one whole lot of fried noodles.\nTop the crispy noodles with the chop suey sauce as required.\nGarnish with a few spring onion greens. You can even garnish with some chopped coriander leaves.\nServe veg american chopsuey immediately.\nNutrition Info (approximate values)\nNutrition Facts\nAmerican Chop Suey\nAmount Per Serving\nCalories 594\nCalories from Fat 198\n% Daily Value*\nFat 22g 34%\nSaturated Fat 3g 19%\nSodium 1695mg 74%\nPotassium 501mg 14%\nCarbohydrates 90g 30%\nFiber 2g 8%\nSugar 11g 12%\nProtein 14g 28%\nVitamin A 6017IU 120%\nVitamin B1 (Thiamine) 1mg 67%\nVitamin B2 (Riboflavin) 1mg 59%\nVitamin B3 (Niacin) 5mg 25%\nVitamin B6 1mg 50%\nVitamin C 32mg 39%\nVitamin E 7mg 47%\nVitamin K 105\u00b5g 100%\nCalcium 88mg 9%\nVitamin B9 (Folate) 81\u00b5g 20%\nIron 4mg 22%\nMagnesium 133mg 33%\nPhosphorus 232mg 23%\nZinc 2mg 13%\n* Percent Daily Values are based on a 2000 calorie diet.\nGOOD KARMA all our content & photos are copyright protected. a lot of time and effort is spent in researching, developing, testing and photographing recipes. please do not copy. as a blogger, if you you want to adapt this recipe or make a youtube video, then please write the recipe in your own words and give a clickable link back to the recipe on this url.\nTRIED THIS RECIPE ? i would love to hear from you. if you have made this recipe then rate the recipe or leave a comment below. if you like this recipe then do share the recipe link on facebook, twitter & pinterest. for instagram mention @vegrecipesofindia or tag #vegrecipesofindia\nCategories Indian Chinese , Noodles , Street Food Recipes , Vegan Recipes\nPost navigation\nTrending Recipes\nEasy Pani Puri\nBhatura Recipe (Bhature without yeast)\n50 tasty besan recipes (gram flour or chickpea flour recipes)\n30 Popular Indian Breakfast Recipes for Foodies\n65 Whole Wheat recipes | Tasty recipes with whole wheat flour (Chapati Atta)\nbest gulab jamun \u2013 2 ways\n35 Best Indian Rice Recipes\nhow to make cake without oven | cake recipes without oven\noats recipes | 14 oatmeal recipes | easy oats recipes for breakfast or snack\npuri recipe for golgappa or pani puri or puchka\nSoft Whole Wheat Bread | 100% Wholemeal Bread from Scratch (Eggless)\nBest Punjabi Samosa Recipe\nyogurt recipes | curd recipes | 30 indian recipes with yogurt or curd\nchivda recipe\ncooker cake | sponge cake in pressure cooker\nWhole Wheat Banana Cake (Eggless and Vegan)\nmomos recipe | dim sum | veg momos\n20 popular indian dinner recipes | lunch recipes\nEggless Chocolate Cake (Whole Wheat)\n20 easy and simple eggless cakes recipes\nPaneer Butter Masala (Restaurant Style)\nrava recipes | 35 sooji recipes | sweets and snacks made with semolina\n21 ripe banana recipes | easy banana dessert recipes\nEasy No Yeast Pizza Dough (Vegan)\n91 delicious paneer recipes\nTomato Puree (Homemade & Without Preservatives)\nwheat cake | eggless wheat flour cake\nGet My Secrets to Great Indian Food\nSign up for my FREE Beginners Guide to Delicious Indian Cooking\nDassana Amit\nnamaste and welcome to vegrecipesofindia.com which i started in feb 2009 and is a pure vegetarian blog. i have been passionate about cooking from childhood and began to cook from the age of 10. later having enrolled in a home science degree greatly enhanced my cooking & baking skills and took it to a different level which i now share as foolproof recipes. i was formally trained both in mainstream indian as well as international cuisines.\nAbout Dassana Amit\nComments are closed.\n16 comments\/reviews\nKaashvi\nFeb 18, 2018\nPlease make a version of Maggi.

Rinse and then chop 250 grams baby corn in 2 to 3 pieces. If they are small in size then no need to chop them.\n2. Take the chopped baby corn in a mixing bowl. Add \u00bc teaspoon black pepper and \u00bc teaspoon salt\u2028 or add as per taste.\n3. Then add 2 tablespoons corn flour (corn starch).\n4. Mix very well.\n5. Heat oil as required in a kadai or pan. You can deep fry or shallow fry the baby corn. Check the oil temperature by adding one piece of baby corn. It should gradually come on top. Then the oil is ready for frying. If it stays at the bottom the oil is not hot enough, so increase the flame. If it comes up too quickly, the oil has become very hot, so reduce the flame.\n6. Add the baby corn pieces.\n7. Begin to fry at medium flame. When one side is crisp and light golden, turn over and fry the second side.\n8. Flip a couple of times and fry till the baby corn pieces become golden and crisp.\n9. Remove with a slotted spoon.\n10. Place fried baby corn on kitchen paper towels. Continue to fry this way in batches.\nB) making corn flour paste\n11. In a small bowl take 2 tablespoons corn flour (corn starch).\n12. Add 2 tablespoon water.\n13. Mix very well to form a smooth paste. Keep aside.\n14. In another pan heat 2 tablespoons oil (sesame or peanut or sunflower oil). Then add 1 teaspoon finely chopped ginger, 2 teaspoons finely chopped garlic and 1 teaspoon finely chopped green chilies.\n15. Saute for one minute on a low flame or till the raw aroma of both ginger and garlic goes away.\n16. Next add \u2153 cup chopped spring onions.\n17. Stir fry on medium to high flame for 1 minute.\n18. Then add \u00bc cup finely chopped capsicum (shimla mirch or green bell pepper).\n19. Mix very well.\n20. Stir fry on medium to high flame for 2 minutes.\n21. Reduce the flame and then add 2 tablespoons tomato ketchup, 1 tablespoon soy sauce and \u2028\u00bd tablespoon red chili sauce (or sweet red chili sauce or sriracha sauce).\n22. Mix very well.\n23. Add 2 cups of water. For a thick gravy or sauce you can add less water.\n24. Mix very well and simmer on a medium to high flame.\n25.\u00a0let the water come to a boil.\n26. Reduce the flame. Then add the corn starch paste. Stir the paste and then add as the corn starch settles down at the bottom of the bowl.\n27. As soon as you add corn starch paste mix very well. In case you see lumps, then using a wired whisk stir and mix. Stirring with wired whisk helps in breaking the lumps.\n28. Simmer on medium to high flame for 3 to 4 minutes. The sauce or gravy will also begin to thicken.\n29. Then add salt as per taste.\n30. Add \u2028\u00bc teaspoon black pepper powder or as required.\n31. Add \u00bd teaspoon sugar or as per taste.\n32.

Cauliflower manchurian is a popular Indo Chinese recipe of pan fried cauliflower florets coated with a spicy sauce. This delicious starter snack is easy to prepare and taste damn good.\nThis crispy gobi manchurian is a dry version and makes for an excellent starter\/side dish or snack. I have already posted a Vegan Gobi manchurian with sauce . when I make veg fried rice or simple fried rice without any veggies, I prepare the gobi manchurian with sauce or as we say in India, with gravy.\nGet My Secrets to Great Indian Food\nSign up for my FREE Beginners Guide to Delicious Indian Cooking\nFairly easy to prepare, this delicious dry gobi manchurian recipe is not spicy like the restaurant or street versions. If you want, you can add more of the ginger, garlic and green chilies and increase the spice and heat in the dish.\nThe gobi manchurian dry that we get outside has a good amount of red color added to the batter. Here, no colors are added. To get an orangish color, you can increase the amount of Kashmiri red chili powder or deghi mirch. This will also add some heat and a smoky flavor.\nTo cut down the fat, I have not deep fried the gobi florets . it does reduce the crispness, though. But as a healthier option, I have pan fried the gobi florets. If you prefer, you can deep fry the batter coated cauliflower florets.\nUsually at home, I serve the gobi manchurian with roti. As thats how we prefer it. You can serve them plain with a spicy sauce like schezwan sauce or even red chili garlic chutney. Even tomato sauce goes well. You can also wrap the cauliflower manchurian in a thin roti and top with some shredded carrots, cabbage and onions along with some sauce.\nYou can also serve this gobi manchurian \u00a0as a snack or as a side dish with\u00a0veg fried rice or\u00a0hakka noodles\u00a0or\u00a0noodles\u00a0or burnt garlic fried rice\u00a0or 5 spice rice.\nHow to make gobi manchurian\nPreparation\n1.\u00a0firstly chop or break the gobi\/cauliflower in medium size florets. Heat water with salt and boil it. Rinse the cauliflower florets and add them to the hot water. Cover and let the cauliflower florets get blanched in the water for 15-20 minutes. Later drain and keep aside.\n2.\u00a0in a bowl mix together the dry ingredients for making the batter.\n3.\u00a0add water and whisk to make a smooth batter without any lumps.\n4. Dip each cauliflower floret in the batter.\n5. Fry the batter coated cauliflower florets in hot oil. I have pan fried and added about 6 tbsp oil. Later I have not added any oil while stir-frying the spring onions etc. You can also deep fry or shallow fry. I have fried in batches of three. So depending on the size of your pan, you can fry at once or in batches. The frying does take some time, so patience is the key.\n6. When one side gets cooked and crisp, turn over each florets and pan fry the uncooked sides. Flip for a couple of times more, so that the florets are evenly fried and light golden.\n7. Drain the fried cauliflower florets on a kitchen paper towel.\nMaking\u00a0gobi manchurian dry\n8. No need to add any oil again. In the same pan, add chopped ginger, garlic and green chilies. Saute for half a minute.\n9. Then add the chopped spring onions & capsicum\/green bell pepper. Increase the flame and stir fry till the capsicum is half cooked or almost cooked.\n10. Add soy sauce, tomato sauce, black pepper and salt. Stir.\n11. Add the pan-fried cauliflower florets.\n12. Stir fry for two to three minutes ensuring the spiced sauce coats the cauliflower florets well. Lastly, add vinegar and stir well. Switch off the fire. Mix in the chopped spring onions greens or garnish with them while serving cauliflower manchurian.\nServe dry gobi manchurian As a snack or as a side dish with veg fried rice or schezwan\u00a0fried rice or cabbage fried rice\u00a0or mushroom\u00a0noodles.\nFew more snacks recipes for you!\nCheese balls\nDry veg manchurian\nWhite sauce pasta\nBaby corn manchurian\nMushroom manchurian\nSTEP BY STEP PHOTOS ABOVE Many of my recipes have detailed step by step photos and useful tips to help you make it easily and perfectly.\nPIN\nPRINT\nGobi Manchurian\n4.77 from 17 votes\nThis cauliflower manchurian dry is a popular indo Chinese recipe of pan fried cauliflower florets coated with a spicy sauce.\nAuthor: Dassana Amit\nPrep Time: 40\nmins\nCook Time: 20\nmins\nTotal Time: 1\nhr\nCourse: snacks\nCuisine: indo chinese\nDiet: vegetarian\nServings (change the number to scale): 4\nto 5\n(1 CUP = 250 ML)\nIngredients\nfor pan frying gobi florets\n1\nmedium cauliflower\n1\ncup\nall purpose flour\n4\ntablespoon\ncorn starch\n\u00bc\nteaspoon\nblack pepper powder\n\u00bc to \u00bd\nteaspoon\nkashmiri red chilli powder\nor deghi mirch (add about 1 teaspoon to get a good color. but this will also increase the heat a bit)\n1\nteaspoon\nsoy sauce\n1\ncup\n+ 1 tablespoon water\nor as required\n5 to 6\ntablespoon\noil for pan frying\nother ingredients\n\u00be\ncup\nchopped spring onion\n(scallion whites) - reserve the greens for garnish\n\u00bd\ncup\nfinely chopped capsicum\n(green bell pepper)\n1.5\ninch\nginger,\nfinely chopped or 3 teaspoon finely chopped ginger\n8 to 10\nmedium garlic,\nfinely chopped or 3 teaspoon finely chopped garlic\n2\ngreen chilies,\nfinely chopped or 1 teaspoon finely chopped green chilies\n\u00bd\ntablespoon\nfinely chopped celery\n(optional)\n1.5\ntablespoon\nlight soy sauce or \u00bd to 1 tablespoon soy sauce\nyou can also add as per your taste\n1\ntablespoon\ntomato sauce\nor add as required\n1\nteaspoon\nrice vinegar\nor \u00bd teaspoon white vinegar or apple cider vinegar\n\u00bc to \u00bd\nteaspoon\nblack pepper powder\nsalt as required\nInstructions\npreparing cauliflower florets\nFirstly chop or break the gobi\/cauliflower in medium size florets.\nHeat water with salt and boil it.
