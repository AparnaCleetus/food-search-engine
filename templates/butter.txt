This delicious butter cake recipes yields a soft butter cake with a light crumb.\nThis is a heavy and filling cake as its rich with butter, so there is no need to do any kind of icing or add powdered sugar on top. Thus this butter cake goes extremely well with a side of coffee, tea or milk.\u00a0this egg free butter cake recipe is also very easy to make.\nGet My Secrets to Great Indian Food\nSign up for my FREE Beginners Guide to Delicious Indian Cooking\nWhile making cakes where butter is one of the main ingredient, a few key points have to be remembered.\nTips for making butter cake\n1. Quality & freshness of butter\nFor any recipe that you make with butter , always use good quality and fresh butter. Avoid butter which has even a faint rancid smell. It will spoil the whole recipe, be it a Cookie , cake\u00a0or a bread, as the rancid aroma will be felt in the final dish. There can also be slight bitter tones in the final product as rancid butter looses it sweetness and becomes bitter.\n2. Type of butter\nFor this butter cake recipe i have used unsalted butter. You can use both yellow or white butter. Even cultured butter can be used. I have used lurpak unsalted butter which is a cultured butter.\u00a0 If using salted butter , then skip adding salt in the dry ingredients.\n3. Type of flour\nThis is one of those cake recipes where I have used all purpose flour (maida). I did make the cake with whole wheat flour, but the result was a dense cake and it did not have the lightness and softness which a butter cake has. Since all purpose flour is used, I would suggest to use organic or unbleached all purpose flour.\n4. Egg substitute\nSweetened condensed milk is used an egg substitute \u00a0in the recipe and it works very well. Since sweetened condensed milk is added, you do not need to add any sugar. The sweetness of the cake using sweetened condensed milk is enough and this cake is not overtly sweet or less sweet.\u00a0the taste of sweetness varies from person to person. So if you feel the taste is less sweet for your tastebuds, then you can always sprinkle some powdered sugar on top of the butter cake. Using a tea strainer, sift the powdered sugar on top of the cake.\n5. On whipping butter\nFor whipping butter I have used a stand mixer. But You can easily whip butter with an electric beater . just take a wide and deep bowl, so that the butter does not fall out while whipping. Whip butter till its light and soft. The better the butter is whipped, the better will be the texture of the cake. However do not overdo the whipping.\nButter can be slightly cold before whipping and in a solid form but smooth and soft. Butter should not be in a melted state while whipping. If you live in a hot or warm climate, then chill butter for some minutes. It should not be hard and solid, but soft and can be pressed.\nFew more\u00a0 Delicious eggless cakes \u00a0on blog are:\nChoco lava cake\nBanana cake\nBlack forest cake\nCooker cake recipe\nEggless chocolate cake recipe .\nSTEP BY STEP PHOTOS ABOVE Many of my recipes have detailed step by step photos and useful tips to help you make it easily and perfectly.\nPIN\nPRINT\nButter Cake\n5 from 5 votes\nThis delicious butter cake recipes yields a soft butter cake with a light crumb.\u00a0\nAuthor: Dassana Amit\nPrep Time: 15\nmins\nCook Time: 1\nhr\nTotal Time: 1\nhr\n15\nmins\nCourse: desserts\nCuisine: world\nDiet: vegetarian\nServings (change the number to scale): 1\nloaf\n(1 CUP = 250 ML)\nIngredients\n200\ngrams\nbutter\n- unsalted\n400\ngrams\nsweetened condensed milk\n1.5\ncups\nlevelled all purpose flour\nor 188 grams\n1.5\nteaspoon\nlevelled baking powder\n\u215b\nteaspoon\nsalt\n(about 2 to 3 pinches)\n1\nteaspoon\nvanilla extract\nor \u00bd teaspoon vanilla essence\nInstructions\nsifting dry ingredients\nTake all the ingredients and keep them ready.\u00a0\nKeep a sieve on top of a bowl.

While the basic method remains the same, there are many variations of murukku made with different ingredients and their proportions.\nThe butter murukku recipe shared here is made from rice flour, roasted chana dal flour and besan. This butter chakli recipe is very easy. You will need a chakli maker or murukku press to prepare these savory snacks.\nI made the murukku twice. First time did not take pics. So then took pics\u00a0the second time when I made them. You can easily double the recipe.\nIf you are looking for more Diwali snacks recipes then do check:\nOmapodi recipe\nRibbon pakoda\nShankarpali recipe\nMixture recipe\nHow to make butter murukku\n1. Take\u00a01 cup or 150 grams rice flour, 1 tablespoon roasted chana dal flour and\u00a02 tablespoons besan (gram flour) in a mixing bowl. For roasted chana dal flour, grind 1 tablespoon roasted chana dal in a small grinder or coffee grinder till fine. Then seive it directly in the pan containing rice flour and besan. If you plan to use roasted chana dal flour for preparing more snacks, then you can grind roasted chana in more quantities too. If you do not have roasted chana dal or roasted chana dal flour, then just skip them and overall add 3 tablespoons besan.\n2. Add 2 tablespoons salted butter. You can also add unsalted butter.\n3. Add \u2153 teaspoon\u00a0salt.\n4.\u00a0now mix everything and rub the butter into the flour with your fingertips till you get a breadcrumb like texture in the flour mixture.\n5. Add \u00bd teaspoon cumin seeds and \u00bd teaspoon hing.\n6. Mix very well with a spoon or with your hands.\n7. Now add water in parts.\n8. Begin to mix and knead the flour.\n9.\u00a0add water in parts and knead to a smooth soft dough. I first added 4 tablespoons water and later added 5 tablespoons. Depending on the quality of flours, you can add less or more water.\n10. Use the star nozzle lid for preparing murukku. Apply some water in the chakli/murukku maker.\n11. Take a portion of the murukku dough and place it inside the murukku maker.\nFrying butter murukku\n12. Heat oil for deep frying in a kadai or pan.\u00a0let the oil become medium hot. Check the oil temperature by adding a small piece of the dough. If the dough comes up gradually and steadily on top, the oil is hot enough to fry. If it comes up too quickly, then oil is too hot. If it settles down at bottom of kadai or comes up very slowly, the oil is not hot enough. Remove the fried piece and check the texture. Follow the tips mentioned below.\nTip 1: if the murukku breaks\u00a0in the oil, the dough is slightly dry. Add a few teaspoons of water. Mix very well and knead the dough again.\nTip 2: if you do not get a proper shape, then this means that the dough has become too moist. Add some rice flour and mix well.\nTip 3: taste the murukku piece and if it feels dense or hard, then add 1 to 2 teaspoon more of butter. Mix very well and knead again.\nTip 4: if the murukku looks very oil and has absorbed too much of oil, then add a few teaspoons of rice flour and mix again. This happens if too much fat has gone in the dough.\n13. When the oil is hot enough, press\u00a0holding the chakli maker directly on top of the oil and let the murukku directly fall in the oil.\u00a0do not over crowd the kadai with murukku. Add as much as needed without overcrowding the kadai.\n14.\u00a0fry till the murukku are half done or have become slightly crisp.\u00a0after adding the murukku, do not touch them immediately with the slotted spoon as they break. They need to become slightly crisp first and then you can turn them over with the slotted spoon.\n15.\u00a0turn over the murukku with a slotted spoon, so that they get fried evenly.\n16.\u00a0keep on turning to get them evenly golden. Fry butter murukku till the sizzling in the oil reduces and the murukku become golden.\n17. Remove butter murukku with a slotted spoon.\n18. Drain murukku on kitchen paper towels to remove excess oil.\n19. In the same way fry all the butter chakli this way in batches.\n20. When cooled, store butter murukku in an air-tight box or jar. Serve butter murukku as festive snack or a tea time snack.\nSTEP BY STEP PHOTOS ABOVE Many of my recipes have detailed step by step photos and useful tips to help you make it easily and perfectly.\nPIN\nPRINT\nButter Murukku\n5 from 6 votes\nButter murukku is a South Indian style murukku made with butter & rice flour.\nAuthor: Dassana Amit\nPrep Time: 5\nmins\nCook Time: 25\nmins\nTotal Time: 30\nmins\nCourse: snacks\nCuisine: south indian\nDiet: vegetarian\nServings (change the number to scale): 3\nto 4\n(1 CUP = 250 ML)\nIngredients\n1\ncup\nrice flour\nor 150 grams rice flour\n1\ntablespoon\nroasted chana dal flour\n(porikadalai flour) or 1 tablespoon roasted chana dal ground to a fine flour\n2\ntablespoons\nbesan\n(gram flour)\n2\ntablespoons\nsalted butter\n- can use unsalted butter also\n\u00bd\nteaspoon\ncumin seeds\n\u00bd\nteaspoon\nasafoetida\n(hing)\n\u2153\nteaspoon\nsalt\nor add as required\n9 to 10\ntablespoons\nwater\nor add as required\noil for deep frying\nInstructions\nmaking butter murukku dough\nTake rice flour, besan and roasted chana dal flour in a mixing bowl or pan.

Paneer butter masala is a rich and creamy dish of paneer (cottage cheese) in a tomato, butter and cashew sauce (known as makhani gravy).\nThe dish has a lovely tang coming from the tomatoes and is slightly sweet with a creamy and velvety feel to it.\nGet My Secrets to Great Indian Food\nSign up for my FREE Beginners Guide to Delicious Indian Cooking\nThis recipe is an easy, quick and delicious method to make paneer butter masala. Within minutes you can prepare this Restaurant style paneer butter masala at home.\nCalled by various names such as butter paneer or butter paneer masala or paneer makhani this dish is of the most popular Indian paneer dish along with Palak paneer , Malai kofta , Paneer tikka masala and Matar paneer . obviously being so popular it is served in many Indian restaurants.\nAbout this paneer butter masala\nDecades back (in some other lifetime!) I would make butter chicken and this paneer butter masala is adapted from that recipe. For the first time, I had learned how to make butter chicken during my home science cooking school days. Later I adapted the same recipe for making paneer butter masala. Plenty of improvisations have happened throughout the years.\nA tried and tested foolproof recipe: this recipe is one of the most popular paneer recipes on the blog and have been made and loved by hundreds of readers. You can read the comments at the end of the post, which has a lot of positive feedback and tips from readers as well as myself.\nMakhani sauce or gravy: the makhani sauce is prepared from scratch with fresh ingredients like tomatoes (specifically pureed tomatoes), cashews and butter. Onions can be added if you want. Though traditionally onions are never added in a makhani gravy.\nRipe red & juicy tomatoes: Tomatoes are a key ingredient here. So do use tomatoes that are ripe and have a slight sweetness in them. Avoid adding tomatoes that are sour or too tart or unripe.\nCashews: yet another important ingredient is cashews which imparts a lovely creaminess and sheen in the dish. The sweetness of the cashews also balances the tanginess of the tomatoes. Generally in butter chicken or butter paneer, cream is added. To give a creamy consistency and a sweet tinge, I add both cashew paste and cream.\nCream: as mentioned above, apart from cashews I also add a bit of cream which thickens the gravy slightly and makes it rich. Though adding cream can be skipped for a less rich version.\nButter: the amount of butter that is added is not huge but just right in the recipe. Butter makes the curry a bit rich and buttery. Though you can go overboard by adding some more butter.\nMaking a vegan version\n1. Tofu: to make a vegan paneer butter masala, replace tofu with paneer. 2. Vegan butter or oil: add a neutral-tasting oil or vegan butter and skip cream altogether. 3. Coconut cream: you can even use coconut cream, but with coconut cream, the flavors of coconut will be felt in the final dish.\nServing suggestions\nWith the staple Indian bread roti: paneer butter masala gravy has a slightly sweet taste and very mildly spiced. Thus making it an excellent gravy with roti or chapati.\nWith other Indian breads: you can serve this dish with naan bread or tandoori roti or plain paratha or pudina paratha or lachha paratha (layered flatbread).\nWith rice: it also goes well with steamed basmati rice or jeera rice (cumin rice).\nCheck out the paneer butter masala video below\nHow to make paneer butter masala\nPreparation\n1. Soak 18 to 20 cashews in \u2153 cup hot water for 20 to 30 minutes.\n2. When the cashews are soaking, you can prep the other ingredients like chopping tomatoes, chopping and preparing the ginger-garlic paste, slicing paneer etc.\n3. Crush 1-inch ginger + 3 to 4 medium-sized garlic to a paste in a mortar pestle to a semi-fine or fine paste. Keep aside. Don\u2019t add any water while crushing ginger & garlic.\n4. After 20 to 30 minutes, drain the water and add the soaked cashews in a blender or grinder. Also, add 2 to 3 tablespoons fresh water or as required.\n5. Grind to a smooth paste without any tiny bits or pieces of cashews.\n6. Remove the cashew paste in a bowl and keep aside.\n7. In the same blender add 2 cups of diced or roughly chopped tomatoes. No need to blanch the tomatoes before blending.\n8. Blend to a smooth tomato puree. Keep aside. Don\u2019t add any water while blending the tomatoes.\nMaking makhani gravy\n9. Heat a thick bottomed pan or a heavy pan. Keep the flame to a low or medium-low. Add 2 tablespoons butter OR 1 tablespoon oil + 1 or 2 tbsp butter in a pan. Adding oil prevents the butter from browning too quickly.\n10. If using only butter, then keep the pan on a low flame so that the butter does not melt. You can even add 3 to 4 tablespoons butter for a rich buttery version. Both salted or unsalted butter can be added.\n10. Keep the flame to a low. Add 1 medium-sized tej patta (Indian bay leaf).\n11. Fry for 2 to 3 seconds or till the oil becomes fragrant from the aroma of the tej patta.\n12. Add the prepared crushed ginger-garlic or 1 teaspoon ready ginger-garlic paste.\n13. Fry for some seconds till the raw aroma of the ginger-garlic disappears.\n14. Pour the prepared tomato puree. Be careful while adding the puree as it may splutter.\n15. Mix it very well with the butter.\n16. Begin to cook the tomato puree on a low to medium-low flame. Stir at intervals.\n17. The tomato puree mixture will start simmering.\n18. In case the tomato puree splutters too much while cooking then cover the pan partly with a lid or cover fully with a splatter lid (channi lid) . the tomato puree might splutter if there is more water content in the tomatoes.\n19. Do stir at intervals.\n20. Simmer the puree for 5 to 6 minutes.\n21. Then add 1 teaspoon Kashmiri red chilli powder or deghi mirch. You can even add \u00bd teaspoon Kashmiri red chilli powder or \u00bc to \u00bd teaspoon of cayenne pepper or paprika or any other variety of red chilli powder.\n22. Mix well and continue to stir and saute the tomato puree.\n23. Saute till the butter starts leaving the sides of the pan and the entire tomato puree mixture comes together as a whole. This entire cooking and sauteing of the tomato puree take about 14 to 17 minutes on a low flame to medium-low flame. Time will vary depending on the thickness of the pan, size, the intensity of flame etc.\n24. Now add the prepare cashew paste.\n25. Mix the cashew paste very well with the cooked tomato puree and continue to stir and saute on a low to medium-low flame. Stir non-stop after adding cashew paste.\n26. Saute till the cashew paste is cooked and again the oil will start to leave the sides of the masala. The cashew will begin to cook fast. Approx 3 to 4 minutes on a low flame. So keep on stirring non-stop.\n27. Next add 1.5 cups water.\nMaking paneer butter masala\n28. Mix the water very well with the tomato-cashew makhani masala. If there are lumps of the tomato-cashew masala, then break with a spoon. You can even use a wired whisk for mixing.\n29. Let the curry simmer and come to a boil. Stir occasionally.\n30. After 2 to 3 mins, add ginger julienne (about 1-inch ginger \u2013 cut in julienne (thin matchstick-like strips). Reserve a few for garnishing. The curry will also begin to thicken.\n31. After 3 to 4 minutes, add 1 or 2 slit green chillies.\n32. Also add salt as per taste and \u00bd to 1 teaspoon sugar (optional). You can add sugar from \u00bc tsp to 1 teaspoon or more depending on the sourness of the tomatoes. Sugar is optional and you can skip it too. If you add cream, then you will need to add less sugar.\n33. Mix very well and simmer for a minute.\n34. After the gravy thickens to your desired consistency, then add the paneer cubes (200 or 250 grams). Keep in mind the consistency you want before you add paneer as you will be cooking the paneer for some seconds. You can also fry the paneer and then add the paneer once the gravy has become creamy. I keep the gravy to a medium consistency gravy.\n35. Stir and mix the paneer cubes gently in the paneer makhani gravy.\n36. Now add 1 teaspoon crushed kasuri methi leaves (dry fenugreek leaves) and 1 teaspoon garam masala in the gravy. Addition of crushed kasuri methi gives a restaurant flavor. Kasuri methi is optional and can be skipped.\n37. Next add 2 to 3 tablespoons of low-fat cream or 1 to 2 tablespoons of whipping cream.\n38. Stir gently but well and switch off the flame.\n39. Serve paneer butter masala hot garnished with 1 to 2 tablespoons of chopped coriander leaves, the remaining ginger julienne. You can also drizzle some cream or dot with butter while serving. Good combo for this dish is naan or butter naan or tandoori rotis or plain paratha or roomali roti or Kerala Malabar paratha.\nIt also goes well with steamed basmati rice or jeera rice or biryani rice. I served with whole wheat roti accompanied by onion-cucumber salad. Also, do serve some lemon wedges by the side.\nTips to make the best paneer butter masala\nTomatoes: since tomatoes are the key ingredient, make sure to use ripe, red and firm tomatoes with a slightly sweet taste. The tomatoes should not be very sour or tangy.\nPaneer (cottage cheese): always use homemade paneer if possible or a good quality store brought fresh paneer. It is best to make paneer at home and does not take much time.\nTomato puree: Do make a really smooth puree from the tomatoes. If you want you can strain the tomato puree also.\nCooking tomato puree: the tomato puree has to be saut\u00e9ed and cooked really well. Oil or butter should leave sides of the tomato paste. If the tomato paste is not saut\u00e9ed well, the raw flavor of tomatoes will be felt in the dish.\nButter: use good quality butter. You can use both unsalted or salted butter. Both yellow butter or white butter can be added.\nCashew paste: to grind cashews to a fine consistency, it is better to soak them in hot water for 30 minutes.\nReplacement for cashews: if you don\u2019t have cashews then the best alternative is almonds. Soak the almonds in hot water for 30 minutes. Then peel them and make a paste of almonds with little water.\nTaste and flavor: if the butter paneer masala gravy tastes tangy or sour, then to balance the sour taste you can add a bit of sugar or cream. But do not add too much sugar as then the gravy becomes too sweet. Also, do note if you add cream then you might have to add less sugar in the butter paneer gravy.\nFrying paneer: you can fry the paneer cubes if you want and then add in the prepared gravy or sauce.\nColor: To get the bright orangish-red color, its best to use Kashmiri red chilli powder or deghi mirch instead of artificial food colors. Using deep red colored tomatoes also contribute to a lovely orange color in the gravy.\nThis recipe is from the archives and has been republished and updated on 21 January 2020.\nSTEP BY STEP PHOTOS ABOVE Many of my recipes have detailed step by step photos and useful tips to help you make it easily and perfectly.\nPIN\nPRINT\nPaneer Butter Masala (Quick Restaurant Style)\n4.88 from 246 votes\nOne of the best paneer butter masala and an easy recipe - which yields a mildly spiced, creamy, tangy and lightly sweet delicious restaurant style paneer butter masala.

It is also served in many restaurants. Another delicious variation which I have already shared is Onion rava dosa \u00a0\nIt is one of those easy to prepare breakfasts that anyone can make. These crisp buttery dosas taste good and are simple enough to prepare.\nGet My Secrets to Great Indian Food\nSign up for my FREE Beginners Guide to Delicious Indian Cooking\nIn this recipe, butter is used instead of oil . you can use both salted butter or unsalted butter. But salted butter tastes better. The flavor of the butter makes a lot of difference to these crisp dosas. You can also use ghee instead of butter.\nWhen preparing them, a few things to keep in mind. \u00a0firstly when adding butter, the tawa or\u00a0pan should not be too hot. The butter should just melt and not get browned or burned. So when adding butter, keep the flame to a medium-low or medium flame. Then pour the dosa batter and then increase the flame to medium or medium-high.\nServe butter rava dosa with coconut chutney or sambar.\nHow to make butter rava dosa\n1. Take \u00bd cup unroasted fine rava, \u00bd cup rice flour and \u00bc cup maida (all-purpose flour) in a bowl. Instead of maida, you can also use whole wheat flour.\n2. Then add \u2153\u00a0cup chopped onions, 1 or 2 green chilies (chopped) and \u00bd inch ginger (chopped).\n3.\u00a0also add \u00bd teaspoon crushed black pepper, \u00bd teaspoon cumin seeds (jeera), 8 to 10 curry leaves (chopped) and salt as required.\n4.\u00a0add 2 cups water.\u00a0depending on the quality of rava and sooji, you can add less or more water \u2013 from 1.5 to 2.5 cups water. I added 2 cups water.\n5.\u00a0whisk till smooth without any lumps. The batter has to be flowing and thin. If the batter looks thick or has a medium consistency, then add more water. If the batter looks very thin and runny, then add some rice flour.\n6. Cover and let the batter rest for 30 minutes.\u00a0once the batter rests, you will see\u00a0that the rava and the flours have settled down and the water will be floating on top.\n7. Before preparing dosas, mix the batter very well.\nCooking butter\u00a0rava dosa\n8. Spread some butter on the tawa. When spreading butter on tawa, keep the flame to a medium-low or medium, so that the butter does not burn or get browned.\n9. With a ladle pour the dosa batter from some height. Start from the edges move\u00a0towards the centre.\n10. If there are big or small gaps, then fill them lightly with the batter.\n11. Increase the flame to medium or medium-high and cook the dosa.\n12. Cook till the top side is done.\n13. When the top side gets\u00a0cooked, then add\u00a0\u00bd to 1 teaspoon butter on the top\u00a0and sides.\n14. Spread butter all over the dosa with a spoon.\n15. It takes a little longer time to cook than the regular Dosa .\n16. Cook till the base is golden and crisp. The more you cook the dosas and the more golden it becomes, the more crisp it will be.\n17. The base should become golden and crisp. Then fold and serve. If you want you can even cook both the sides. When preparing the next dosa, again reduce the flame to low-medium or medium and then spread butter.\n18. Fold and then serve hot with coconut chutney and sambar.

I have made these cookies before too and they taste very good and go well with tea or coffee.\nGet My Secrets to Great Indian Food\nSign up for my FREE Beginners Guide to Delicious Indian Cooking\nWe are fond of cookies. Thats true. Whenever we go to any big store or a shopping mall, we always lookout for the cookie shops or the cookie section. Usually, I end up buying healthy cookies made with whole wheat or multi grain flour or millet flours. Surprisingly and on the contrary, there are very few cookie recipes posted on the blog. Since I often bake cookies without taking pics. In fact, I have one big book dedicated to only making cookies.\nThese cookies have the buttery taste & flavor and are also crisp . they make for a nice festive gift. These also go very well with a cup of milk or tea/coffee. Usually in the morning, when I don\u2019t have time to make an elaborate breakfast, I serve cookies with milk or tea.\nFor the sugar in cookies , I always powder organic unrefined cane sugar or raw sugar. Unrefined cane sugar is much better than bleached white sugar. These butter cookies just have the right amount of sweetness. They are not sweet like sugar cookies. I do try to bake cookies and biscuits with whole wheat flour. But at times depending on the recipe, I do add all purpose flour.\nServe these butter cookies plain or with milk or hot chocolate or tea/coffee. They also go well as a side sweet snack in tiffins.\nHow to make butter cookies\nMaking cookies dough\n1. In a blender or grinder, add \u00bd cup sugar and seeds of 4 to 5 green cardamoms.\n2.

Cut the butter into cubes or sticks and then add.\n6. With your fingertips break the butter and mix with the flour.\u00a0you can cut the butter in the flour with two knives too. This can also be achieved with a food processor or a stand mixer.\u00a0if the butter melts while mixing with your hands, keep the mixture in the fridge for some minutes and then start again.\n7.

Bake in a preheated oven at 180 degrees celsius/356 degrees fahrenheit for 15 to 25 minutes or more till the butter cookies are light golden or golden. Temperatures vary from oven to oven, so do keep a check whilst the cookies are baking. For slight moist and crumbly taste, don\u2019t brown the cookies. For a crisp texture, brown the cookies lightly. Depending on the size of the butter cookies, it may take more or less time for the cookies to bake. Keep the cookie tray in the center rack if using an OTG. Don\u2019t keep it on the tray touching the bottom heating rods. Or else the butter cookies burn from the base.\n5.\u00a0once baked, remove when still hot and place them on a wired tray or rack. So that the cookies cool.

I tried some of your recipes and they always turn out so well. I have become a big fan of yours. Moreover i am a vegetarian so i just love and trust all your recipes. Thinking to try baking cookies this time but i am a little diet conscious. Can i reduce the amount of butter for this recipe? And to prepare salted cookies, can i follow the same recipe eliminating sugar? Regards\ndassana amit\nAug 30, 2019\nthanks a lot nisha. yes you can reduce the amount of butter. not only for this cookie recipe but any recipe. you can try with salt and add some cumin or ajwain. also add a bit of sugar to balance the saltiness. you will get a nice sweet-salt taste in the cookies.\nKarthika Mukundh\nJun 26, 2019\nHi Dassana, I am a great fan of your recipes. I like experimenting with new cuisines. I happened to reach your blog by chance few years ago. Since then, I turn to your blog whenever I am trying new recipes; even if it\u2019s from other books, I want to see if you had done it and compare the recipes. Because I just can\u2019t resist relying on your recipes. ???? After we started giving solid food to my daughter, I tried this butter cookie recipe. My daughter, my husband, my in-laws \u2013 everyone loved it; of course me too. I liked it better because of all the compliments from the family. Though I never thought of sharing my comments (as I know that I can\u2019t make it short ????), I thought of writing it today. Because I am going to make it with my daughter today. She\u2019s very happy and excited. Seeing her like that, it made me write this long comment. Keep those wonderful recipes coming. Our best to you. Love Karthika Mukundh\ndassana amit\nJun 26, 2019\nhi karthika, i felt so good reading your comment and pleased too know that the butter cookies were loved by everyone in your family. of course, you can write long comments. even i have many cookbooks. i hardly ever use them. on the occasions i do, i see glaring errors or mistakes in the recipes eg too much of sugar in a cake or too much of spices or oil in a gravy or curry recipe.\nthanks again and i wish you all the best. happy cooking.\nNalini\nFeb 01, 2019\nHello Dassana, I have been baking these cookies for the past 3 years and they turn out awesome every time. I love your recipes as they are always healthy. My son is fond of spicy snacks. His exams are round the corner and I don\u2019t want to give him fried stuff. Can I make this cookie spicy? Please let me know what I should add and the proportion. Once again my heartfelt wishes to you for the good work that you are doing. Thanks\ndassana\nFeb 01, 2019\nthanks nalini. yes you can make then spicy or spicy-sweet, whatever your son likes. no need to change the proportions of any ingredient. since sugar is not there, you may need to add some more milk while binding.\nNil\nOct 30, 2018\nThank you o much You made my work easy through this receip\nSneh\nOct 17, 2018\nHi !! Hour recipie sounds awsm but can we use brown sugar instead and if yes , then do we need to powder the same also .\ndassana amit\nOct 18, 2018\nyes you can use brown sugar. no need to powder brown sugar.\nRUPini\nOct 05, 2018\nHi Dasaana.. my family loves the cookies. They are a hit. The shapes are so cute. I replaced butter with cold coconut oil. I also added vanilla. Thanks ao much. Hare Krishna\ndassana amit\nOct 05, 2018\nthanks rupini for sharing the feedback. yes coconut oil is a good substitute. even i use coconut oil on occasions in cookies. hare krishna.\nVasu Reddy\nFeb 01, 2018\nAmit..very nice recipes..but need clarity on the baking soda or baking powder. But you also are adding yogurt as an ingredient. What us better\u2026B soda or B powder please?\ndassana amit\nFeb 01, 2018\nbaking soda is pure sodium bicarbonate. baking powder is a mixture of sodium bicarbonate when moistened releases carbon dioxide which helps in rising of baked stuff. baking powder contains sodium bicarbonate, an acidifying agent (cream of tartar), and also a drying agent (usually starch). same function as baking soda. however baking soda is three times more stronger than baking powder. yogurt is added as it is an acidic agent and when it reacts with an alkaline substance like baking soda or baking powder, it releases carbon dioxide. depending on the recipe and other ingredients used, you can decide what to add.\nAishwarya\nDec 06, 2017\nCan i add choco chip in these cookies? Will it taste good?\ndassana amit\nDec 07, 2017\nAishwarya, yes you can add. the cookies will taste good with choco chips.\nMichelle\nDec 06, 2017\nCan I use All Purpose flour instead of whole wheat flour in your butter cookie recipe and keep all other ingredients the same.\ndassana amit\nDec 06, 2017\nMichelle, yes you can. but add less milk because whole wheat flour absorbs more liquids.\nGarima\nSep 13, 2017\nI am a huge fan of your recipes. I have tried a lot and they all come out so awesome. Trust me, I have tried many recipes but yours are the only one who are full proof and never fails. I recently started baking and tried your nankhatai, banana cake and both were too good. The best part is your choice of healthy ingredients. I don\u2019t buy maida and you never post any baking recipe with it. Thanks for that. You are amazing! Just one request, could you add more cookies recipe. I am finding them tough. I would love to see ragi cookies, semolina cookies etc. Also some savory baking recipes would be great. I am sorry if that is too much to ask for. Bless you!\ndassana amit\nSep 13, 2017\nthank you garima for these words. i have some recipes with maida, but as far as possible i do avoid baking with it. i do want to add more cookie recipes. in fact i had developed a batch of oats cookies recipe recently and they were awesome. did not take pics, but yes i will add the recipe in some time. and yes ragi cookies have been asked by many readers. just that i have not tried making cookies with it. so i will need to develop a good fool proof recipe with ragi. even rava cookies have been requested. so will try to add them.\nyou are not asking too much and please don\u2019t be sorry. i can understand as good eggless baked recipes are sometimes difficult to get in media like internet or books. i have myself tried eggless baking recipes from books and at times the recipes have failed miserably. also i am working on a butter cake recipe with whole wheat flour. both times the texture of cake did not come out as expected. so eventually after trying and testing, i will add these eggless cake and cookie recipes.\nCharu Arora\nSep 02, 2017\nHi Amit Thanks for writing nice and easy receipies.

With a crispy streusel topping of whole wheat flour (not oats) and a juicy, jammy apple stuffing, this dessert is delish and yum.\nI love baking with fruits and I simply love apples in desserts like Apple Pie , Apple Cake , Apple Halwa . My love for baking makes me try and test various recipes which I then share on the blog if the recipe is successful after various baking attempts.\nGet My Secrets to Great Indian Food\nSign up for my FREE Beginners Guide to Delicious Indian Cooking\nI often make baked dishes like crumble, cobbler and crisp with fruits. I have made apple crumble so many times and so thought of sharing the recipe. In this recipe, you get an apple crumble that has a crispy top and a moist jammy apple stuffing. There is no watery consistency in the filling.\nWhat is a crumble ?\nA crumble is a baked dish with a streusel topping. It can be both savory and sweet. The streusel topping gives a lovely crispy texture to the crumble after getting baked. With fruits, a sweet version is made. With meat or vegetables and cheese a savory version can be made. Fruits like apple, peach, various types of berries, plum, apricot, rhubarb are commonly used to make a crumble.\nThis Easy Apple Crumble is\nMade with whole wheat flour\nNo oats have been added\nHas fresh apples\nVery easy\nApples are not separately cooked thus saving some time\nServing Apple Crumble\nApple crumble can be served warm or at room temperature. You can serve it plain or accompany it with vanilla ice cream or custard or whipped cream. Leftover apple crumble should be refrigerated. While serving later, just warm in the oven for some minutes and then serve.\nA note on Apples\nRed apples taste best in this recipe. You can use any variety of red apples. Even green apples that have a sour-sweet profile taste good. If you prefer some tartness in the crumble than opt for green apples. You can even use canned apples.\nHow to make apple crumble\nMaking apple filling\n1. Firstly rinse 4 medium-sized apples (500 grams) in running water. Drain all the water. Then peel them. Removed the seeds and pith. Chop apples in 1-inch cubes.\n2. Take the apples in a mixing bowl. Sprinkle 60 grams sugar or 6 tablespoons sugar (can use granulated sugar, powdered sugar or castor sugar), \u00bd teaspoon ground cinnamon, \u00bd teaspoon lemon juice and \u215b teaspoon ground nutmeg (optional).\n3.\u00a0Add \u00bd teaspoon lemon juice.\n4. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons whole wheat flour.\n5. Mix very well and keep aside.\n6. Grease a baking tray or pan with some butter. Keep aside.\nMaking streusel stuffing\n7. In a mixing bowl take 75 grams cold butter cubes (\u2153 cup).\n8. Add \u00bd cup castor sugar or powdered sugar (100 grams). Please do not use granulated sugar as it does not melt while baking and gives a terrible granular texture to the top streusel layer.\n9. Add 1 teaspoon vanilla extract or \u00bd teaspoon vanilla essence.\n10. Top with 1 cup whole wheat flour (120 grams), \u00bd teaspoon baking powder and a pinch salt.\n11. With a pastry cutter cut the butter in the flour till you get a sandy bread crumb like texture in the flour. You can also use a knife or your fingers to mix the butter with the flour. You can also use a stand mixer with the paddle attachment. If butter begins to melt then keep the mixture in the fridge for some minutes.\n12. The texture of the streusel should be like a bread crumb texture.\nLayering 13. Place the apples stuffing in the greased pan. Layer the apple neatly in the pan. Also preheat the oven for 15 minutes at 180 degrees Celsius or 356 degrees Fahrenheit.\n14. With a spoon sprinkle the streusel topping evenly all over the apples.\n15. Sprinkle in such a way that you get an even layer of the streusel stuffing on the apples.\nBaking\n16. Place the pan in the preheated oven.\n17. Bake at 180 degrees Celsius or 356 degrees Fahrenheit for 40 minutes till golden on top. Oven temperatures vary so do keep a check.\n18. Let the apple crumble become warm and then serve. You can serve with ice cream, custard or whipped cream.\nApple Crumble Tips & Variations\nOats: For a more crunchy and crispy texture, you can add oats. Add \u00bd cup rolled oats and \u00bd cup whole wheat flour or all-purpose flour.\nFlour: You can use all-purpose flour instead of whole wheat flour.\nMixing: You can mix the flour with butter using a stand mixer with the paddle attachment. You can also mix with your hands.\nVegan options: You can use solid coconut oil instead of butter. If coconut oil is in liquid form, then refrigerate for some minutes till it solidifies. Use maple syrup or raw sugar for apple stuffing. For the streusel use maple syrup or powdered unrefined raw sugar.\nSugar: Do use castor sugar or powdered sugar for the streusel layer. Granular sugar does not melt or dissolve and gives a grainy coarse texture which is not pleasant while eating.\u00a0For the apple filling, you can add granulated sugar, raw sugar, powdered sugar, brown sugar or castor sugar\nButter: You can both salted butter or unsalted butter. If using salted butter, then skip the salt in the recipe.\nSTEP BY STEP PHOTOS ABOVE Many of my recipes have detailed step by step photos and useful tips to help you make it easily and perfectly.\nPIN\nPRINT\nApple Crumble\n5 from 10 votes\nApple Crumble made the old fashioned way - with a crisp streusel topping of whole wheat flour (not oats) and a juicy, jammy apple stuffing.

I bake often and most of the time I end up making cobblers and crumbles with fruits. I make peach cobbler when peaches are in season.\nSince it is the season of peaches in India, I thought of sharing an easy peach cobbler recipe that I make during the peach season. One which is truly delish, juicy & moist with peachy flavors.\nGet My Secrets to Great Indian Food\nSign up for my FREE Beginners Guide to Delicious Indian Cooking\nWhat is a cobbler?\nCobbler is a baked dish made with fruits or vegetables and topped with a cake batter or a biscuit or scone topping . so a cobbler can be both sweet or savory. Cobbler recipes are popular both in the united states and the united kingdom.\nThere are many varieties of cobbler recipes and many ways to make it. Fruit cobblers are popular as compared to the savory versions made with veggies. Fruits like peaches, blueberries, apples, blackberries, cherry, strawberry, apricots are commonly used to make a cobbler.\nWhat is the difference between a cobbler and a crumble?\nThough both cobbler and crumble are used in place of each other for the same dish, a crumble is a different dish. The difference lies in the topping where a streusel layer is placed on the fruits in a crumble recipe.\nThe streusel topping can be made with flour or with a combination of oats and flour. Adding rolled oats in a crumble makes for a crunchy and crispy topping. But just with flour too, you can get a crisp texture without the crunchiness of the oats.\nThis easy peach cobbler recipe is\nMade with whole wheat flour (like most of my baking recipes)\nHas fresh peaches (though canned peaches can be used too)\nTopped with cake batter\nVery easy and can be made even by beginners\nPeaches are not separately cooked thereby saving some time\nServing peach cobbler\nPeach cobbler can be served warm or at room temperature. You can serve it plain or accompany with vanilla ice cream. Leftover peach cobbler needs to be refrigerated. While serving later, just warm slices of peach cobbler in the oven for some minutes.\nA note on peaches\nYou can use any variety of peaches but just make sure they are sweet. You don\u2019t want to end up with a very sour tasting cobbler.\nA slight tart-sweet taste in the peaches is also fine. So adjust sugar according to the taste of the peaches. You can even use canned peaches.\nHow to make peach cobbler\nPreparing peaches\n1. Rinse peaches gently in water using a colander. Drain all water. Then peel 500 grams peach or 6 to 7 medium to large-sized peaches. Ripe peaches will be easier to peel.\n2. Cut them into half and remove the stones. Chop all of them into 1 to 1.5 inches chunks. Do not chop them finely.\n3. Take the chopped peaches in a bowl. You will need 2 cups chopped peaches. Add \u00bc cup sugar. This is the proportion of sugar below which I follow according to the taste of peaches.\nSweet-tasting peaches \u2013 \u00bc cup sugar.\nLess to moderately tart and sweet-tasting peaches (having a sweet-sour taste) \u2013 \u2153 to \u00bd cup sugar.\n4. Mix very well and keep aside. The sugar will dissolve in the juices from the chopped peaches. Meanwhile, also preheat the oven for 15 minutes at 190 degrees celsius or 370 degrees fahrenheit. Use both the top and bottom heating elements for preheating as well as for baking.\nMelting butter & making batter for peach cobbler\n5. Take unsalted butter (roughly 50 to 60 grams) in a small bowl or a small pan. Let it melt on a stovetop on a low flame. You can even melt butter in the oven in the pan that you will use to bake (use a 9\u00d79 inch square baking pan). You will need about 7 tablespoons of melted butter. Keep melted butter aside. You can also use salted butter. Use vegan butter for a vegan version.\n6. In a bowl, take 1 cup whole wheat flour, 2 teaspoons baking powder and 1 pinch salt. Please use good quality aluminium free baking powder, so that you do not get the metallic aluminium taste and smell.\n7. Mix very well with a spoon or whisk. Add \u00bd teaspoon vanilla extract, \u00bc teaspoon cinnamon powder and 2 pinches of nutmeg powder. Skip salt if using salted butter.\n8. Next, add \u00bd cup sugar (8 tablespoons sugar). You can use less sugar too. At times I have made a cobbler with 6 tablespoons sugar and the taste is mildly sweet but not sweet enough.\n9. Again mix very well with a spoon or whisk.\n10. Pour 1 cup milk or add as required. For a vegan cobbler, use almond milk, cashew milk or thin coconut milk.\n11. With a whisk mix well. Mix with light pressure. You do not want gluten strands to form in the batter. You can even mix by using the cut and fold technique. Tiny lumps are alright in the batter. The consistency of the batter is medium flowing like that of a pancake batter. Addition of milk will depend on the texture and quality of the flour. So if the batter looks too thick, then add a few tablespoons more of milk. You can even use all-purpose flour, but just add less of the milk.\nLayering for peach cobbler\n12. Pour the melted butter in a ceramic or stoneware 9\u00d79 inch square baking dish. This step of adding melted butter in the pan can also be done once you have melted butter and before making the batter.\n13. Gently pour the batter on top of the melted butter layer.\n14. Do not stir or mix. Do not even shake or tilt the pan.\n15. Using a spoon, top the chopped peaches on the batter. Do not press. Just gently place the peaches on the batter all over and evenly. Pour the leftover peach juice from the bowl on top of the peaches all over.\n16. Cover the entire surface of the pan with peaches and sugar mixture. Do not make the peach layer even or stir or shake the pan. Do not press the peaches in the cake batter. Let them float on top of the cake batter. When baking, the cake batter will rise at the top.\nBaking peach cobbler\n17. Now place the pan in a preheated oven. Bake at 190 degrees celsius or 370 degrees fahrenheit for 40 to 60 minutes. Oven time varies and the only way you will now that the peach cobbler is baked well is by checking the crust \u2013 it should look crisp and golden. Do not open the oven too often. Bake without interruption for the first 30 minutes and then later you can check by opening the oven door.\n18. Once the top crust looks golden and crisp, remove from the oven. I usually bake for some more minutes to get a nice crispy crust at the sides. Let the peach cobbler become warm or cool at room temperature.\n19. Later remove peach cobber slices with a spoon and serve it plain or with vanilla ice cream. Enjoy this homemade peach cobbler.\nSTEP BY STEP PHOTOS ABOVE Many of my recipes have detailed step by step photos and useful tips to help you make it easily and perfectly.\nPIN\nPRINT\nPeach Cobbler\n4.75 from 4 votes\nA peach cobbler recipe that is easy, homemade and delicious.

Any other replacement you would recommend?\ndassana amit\nAug 13, 2019\nyou can use oil, but add less oil. so 1/4th cup of a neutral-flavoured oil like sunflower oil will do. you can even use coconut oil, but the cobbler will have coconut flavors. if you are fine with that then 1/4th cup coconut oil can be added. hope this helps.\nsarah\nAug 23, 2019\nThanks so much! I am excited to try. Canned peaches would work, right?\ndassana amit\nAug 23, 2019\nwelcome sarah. yes, canned peaches will work. with canned peaches, you won\u2019t need to sugar to the peach stuffing. the syrup of the canned peaches will work fine. preserve about 1/4 to 1/3 cup of the syrup and top it with the canned peaches.\nmenu\nHome\nRecipes Index\nBy Ingredients\nBhindi (Okra)\nBrinjal (Eggplant)\nCabbage\nCapsicum\nCauliflower\nChickpeas\nFenugreek\nMushroom\nPaneer Recipes\nGreen Peas\nSpinach\nPotato\nBy Indian Cuisine\nAndhra Recipes\nBengali Recipes\nGoan Recipes\nGujarati Recipes\nHyderabadi Recipes\nKarnataka Recipes\nKashmiri Recipes\nKerala Recipes\nKonkan Recipes\nMaharashtrian Recipes\nNorth Indian Food\nPunjabi Recipes\nSouth Indian Food\nUttar Pradesh Cuisine\nTamil Nadu Recipes\nBreakfast\nEasy Breakfast\nIdli\nDosa Varieties\nParatha Recipes\nSnacks\nStarters & Snacks\nStreet Food\nEvening Snacks\nBread Snacks\nPakora Recipes\nSandwich Recipes\nSweets & Desserts\nBurfi (Fudge)\nCookies\nDesserts\nEggless Cakes\nIce Cream\nHalwa Recipes\nKheer and Payasam\nLadoo Recipes\nSweets\nBeverages\nBeverages\nJuices\nMilkshakes\nSmoothie\nTea & Coffee\nRice\nIndian Rice Recipes\nPulao Recipes\nBiryani Varieties\nMain Course\nVegetables\nCurry\nDal (Lentils) & Legumes\nSambar\nPasta Recipes\nPizza Recipes\nIndian Breads\nIndian Chinese\nBread Recipes\nInstant Pot\nAccompaniments\nChutney Recipes\nPickles\nRaita Recipes\nSalad Recipes\nRasam Varieties\nSoup Recipes\nSpecial Diet\nVegan Recipes\nGluten Free Recipes\nLow Fat Recipes\nSatvik \u2013 No Onion NO Garlic\nNavratri & Fasting Recipes\nDIY\nSpice Mix\nCondiment\nDIY\nAbout\nfree email series\nGet My Secrets to Great Indian Food\nSign up for my FREE Beginners Guide to Delicious Indian Cooking\nFIND A RECIPE\nSearch for:\nNamaste.

Could you please tell me which kind of utensils can I use in tha convection mode of the oven ? I mean the material. I can\u2019t find anything online \ud83d\ude41\ndassana amit\nMar 28, 2016\nchandni, you will have an instruction book and in that the materials will be mentioned. also a staff from the company comes and demonstrates on how to operate the oven. convection mode is used for baking. so any material which is used for baking in an OTG or a regular oven can be used in the convection mode. for baking aluminium trays or pans can be used. but these aluminium trays and pans should be meant for baking only. they will be available in a shop which sells baking stuff. you can also use borosil glass pans or bowls which are specifically meant for baking. but do remember that metals like aluminium cannot be used when you operate the oven in the microwave mode. metals will cause arcing (sparks).\nthe ones available in shops locally are reasonable in rates, then the ones available online. local brands will not be expensive, but imported ones from usa or europe are very expensive. also avoid non stick pans or trays and even silicon ones. have mentioned a aluminium muffin mould link below. however do check the size of your oven before you buy any pan or tray.\nhttp://www.pepperfry.com/rolex-aluminium-muffin-bakeware-tray-9-cavity-1345372.html?type=clip&pos=7:1\nMeenakshi\nMar 28, 2016\nI am new to cooking and thinking to follow this website to try my hands in cooking, today prepared garlic bread recipe which my husband really liked.

Delicious, crisp and fluffy waffles made with whole wheat flour (chapati atta). Pancakes and waffles are made on occasions for breakfast. I use my Eggless pancake recipe to make these waffles.\nTo make these waffles you will need a waffle maker . I have a sandwich toaster which has waffle plates. So I use these waffle plates to make waffles. You can easily make\u00a0these waffles in a waffle maker also.\nGet My Secrets to Great Indian Food\nSign up for my FREE Beginners Guide to Delicious Indian Cooking\nIn these whole wheat waffles the fluffiness comes from using hot milk which is later mixed with baking powder. Baking powder reacts in the liquid medium to release carbon dioxide which aerates the batter, which in turn makes the waffles fluffy and soft.\nMaking waffles is easy and won\u2019t take much time. these whole wheat waffles are not sweet. So they are best served with some jam like strawberry jam or fig jam or mango jam or mixed fruit jam or with\u00a0whipped cream or syrups like honey or maple syrup or dates syrup or jaggery syrup.\nIf using honey, then pour honey on the pancakes when they become warm. If you or your family loves chocolate then you can use chocolate syrup.\nTo make sweet waffles you can always add more sugar. You can even skip adding sugar for sugar free waffles. For a healthier variation add jaggery or coconut sugar or palm jaggery. The recipe yields 6 waffles and can be easily halved or doubled or tripled.\nHow to make eggless whole wheat waffles\nA) mixing dry ingredients\n1. In a mixing bowl first take 1 cup whole wheat flour (chapati atta). If the wheat flour is ground in a mill, then do sieve the flour once or twice before using.\n2. Add 1 pinch salt. Skip adding salt if using salted butter.\n3. Add \u00bc teaspoon cinnamon powder.\n4. Next add 3 teaspoons sugar. You can even add more sugar or skip it entirely.\n5. Add 1 teaspoon baking powder.\n6. With a wired whisk mix all the dry ingredients very well. Keep aside.\n7. Preheat the waffle pan or waffle maker.\nMixing wet ingredients for making waffles\n8. Take 1.5 to 1.75 cups milk in a sauce pan. Keep the pan on a medium-low flame and begin to heat milk. You can also use almond milk or soy milk.\n9. When the milk is becoming hot do stir occasionally. Do not boil the milk but let it just become hot. You should see some steam coming from the milk.\n10. When the milk becomes hot, add 1 tablespoon unsalted butter. You can also use oil instead of butter. Use a neutral flavored oil.\n11. Mix the butter in the hot milk very well.\n12. Then add \u00bd teaspoon Vanilla extract .\n13. Mix again well.\nMaking waffles batter\n14. Pour the milk mixture to the dry ingredients in the bowl.\n15. With a wired whisk begin to mix gently but well. Break lumps with whisk and make a smooth batter. A few tiny lumps are fine in the batter.\n16. The waffle batter is of a pourable consistency and not thick. If the batter looks thick, then you can add \u00bc to \u2153 cup more of hot milk. Depending on quality of whole wheat flour more milk can be added.\nMaking whole wheat waffles\n17. When the waffle pan or waffle maker become hot, spread some softened unsalted butter on it. In case you are using the pan for the first time then be more generous in spreading the butter.\n18. Using a \u2153 to \u00bd measuring cup or a ladle, pour the batter evenly on the waffle plates.\n19. Pour in the second waffle mould as well.\n20. Close the waffle maker and cook the waffle for 7 to 8 minutes or more till the top looks crisp and golden.\n21. When the waffles look crisp and golden, then open the waffle maker.\n22. Gently remove the waffles with a wooden spatula. Make waffles in a similar way. Do brush some butter before making every batch of eggless waffles.\n23. Serve the whole wheat waffles hot or warm with any toppings of your choice.\nMore breakfast recipes\nBanana pancake\nBesan ka chilla \u00a0(spiced savory gram flour pancakes)\nAdai dosa (delicious protein-rich pancake)\nMoong dal dosa\nScallion pancakes\nSTEP BY STEP PHOTOS ABOVE Many of my recipes have detailed step by step photos and useful tips to help you make it easily and perfectly.\nPIN\nPRINT\nWhole Wheat Waffles\n4.75 from 8 votes\nThese whole wheat waffles are delicious, crisp and fluffy waffles made without eggs.\nAuthor: Dassana Amit\nPrep Time: 5\nmins\nCook Time: 20\nmins\nTotal Time: 25\nmins\nCourse: breakfasts,snacks\nCuisine: world\nServings (change the number to scale): 6\nwaffles\n(1 CUP = 250 ML)\nIngredients\n1\ncup\nlevelled whole wheat flour\nor 120 grams\n1\npinch\nsalt\n1\nteaspoon\nlevelled baking powder\n\u00bc\nteaspoon\ncinnamon powder\n3\nteaspoons\nsugar\nor add as per taste\n1.5 to 1.75\ncups\nmilk\nor add as required\n1\ntablespoon\nunsalted butter\nor oil\n\u00bd\nteaspoon\nvanilla extract\nor \u00bc teaspoon vanilla essence\nunsalted butter\nor oil, add as required, for brushing on waffle plates\nInstructions\nmixing dry ingredients\nIn a mixing bowl first take 1 cup whole wheat flour (chapati atta).

These are spiced and ginger flavored cookies made with whole wheat flour.\nGingerbread\u00a0cake \u00a0and gingerbread cookies or gingerbread men cookies are popular in the west during this season. Every year around this time, I do make ginger bread cake and fruit cake.\nGet My Secrets to Great Indian Food\nSign up for my FREE Beginners Guide to Delicious Indian Cooking\nGinger being a warming spice, is good to be included in the food in winters. We also add ginger in our everyday tea.\nGinger bread cakes or cookies are usually made with molasses.\u00a0in this recipe I have used kakvi instead of molasses. Kakvi is a molasses like thick syrup made from sugar cane juice. Its a syrup which is made while preparing jaggery.\nThe sweetness in kakvi is comparable to that of honey. Kakvi is available in some parts of maharashtra, India.\nQuoted from Wikipedia :\nMolasses (\u0915\u093e\u0915\u0935\u0940), a byproduct of the production of jaggery, is used in rural maharashtra and Karnataka as a sweetener. It contains many minerals not found in ordinary sugar and is considered beneficial to health in traditional ayurvedic medicine. It is an ingredient of many sweet delicacies, such as gur ka chawal (\u201cjaggery rice\u201d), a traditional Rajasthani or Punjabi dish.\nThese gingerbread cookies are sweet with a soft, firm texture. The aromatic ginger, cinnamon and cloves infuse a great deal of flavor in the cookies. The home smells so good when baking these cookies. The recipe has been loosely adapted from a long lost baking book I have.\nYou can also check these Cookie recipes :\nButter cookies\nNankhatai\nTutti frutti cookies\nCoconut macaroons\nChocolate chip cookies\nYou can even make these gingerbread cookies with molasses . I would not suggest honey as honey when heated becomes toxic according to Ayurveda. Even jaggery can be used . I have mentioned the jaggery proportions in the recipe card & step wise pics above.\nServe these\nEggless gingerbread cookies as dessert snack or as a tea time snack.\nHow to make gingerbread cookies\n1. First grease the\u00a0baking tray with some butter and keep aside.\n2. Now take \u00bd cup softened butter (100 grams) in a mixing bowl. I have used salted butter. If using unsalted butter, then add a pinch of salt when sifting the whole wheat flour. You can also use ghee instead of butter.\n3. Add \u00bd cup of molasses or kakvi. If using jaggery, then add \u00bd cup powdered jaggery in 3 to 4 tbsp hot water. Mix well till the jaggery melts. If impurities are there, then filter the jaggery syrup.\n4. Begin to mix and beat this mixture.\n5. I have used wired whisk to mix\u00a0the butter with the kakvi. You can also use an electric beater.\n6. Mix and lightly beat this mixture. Keep aside.\n7. In a separate bowl or plate, sift\u00a02 cups whole wheat flour, \u00bd tsp baking soda,\u00a02 tsp ginger powder, \u00bc tsp cinnamon powder, \u00bc tsp clove powder\u00a0and \u00bc tsp nutmeg powder.\u00a0instead of ginger powder, you can also add 3 tsp fresh ginger paste or minced/grated ginger.\n8. Here are the sifted dry ingredients.\n9. Now add the entire sifted dry ingredients to the lightly beaten butter+molasses mixture.\n10. Gently and lightly fold or mix.\n11. Then add \u00bc cup of hot water.\n12. Mix everything together and gather to form a dough. Do not knead . just gently mix or fold. If the mixture\u00a0is loose or sticky, then add\u00a02 to 3 tbsp more of the flour. If the dough looks dry or crumbly, then add 1 to 3 tbsp hot water and mix again. Cover and place the dough in the refrigerator for 30 to 45 minutes.\nBaking gingerbread cookies\n13. Later, remove and pinch small balls from the cookie dough. Gently press and flatten them. Place them with an inch space between them on the baking tray. Preheat oven at 180 degrees C/356 degrees Fahrenheit for 15 minutes before you begin to bake the cookies.\n14. Sprinkle some sugar granules on the cookies. Lightly press the sugar granules on the cookies. You can also use brown sugar. For one batch, I used cane sugar and for the second one, I used brown sugar.\n15. Bake the cookies at 180 degrees celsius//356 degrees Fahrenheit for 20 to 25 minutes or till the cookies appear light golden. Do not over bake the cookies. since oven temperatures vary, it may takes less or more time. So do keep a check.\nFor convection ovens use the preheating and baking temperature of 160 degrees celsius/320 degrees fahrenheit. In an OTG, keep the tray on the center rack with both the top and bottom heating elements on.\n16. The base should be golden as you see in the pic below. I baked the cookies in two batches as I have a small oven. If you have a big oven, you can bake these cookies in one go.\n17. After one minute, remove the gingerbread cookies on a wired tray and let them cool.\n18. Once cooled at room temperature, Store gingerbread cookies in an airtight jar. The recipe yields about 500 grams of cookies. Serve these cookies as a dessert snack or you can even gift them to family and friends.\nSTEP BY STEP PHOTOS ABOVE Many of my recipes have detailed step by step photos and useful tips to help you make it easily and perfectly.\nPIN\nPRINT\ngingerbread cookies\n4.8 from 5 votes\nEggless gingerbread cookies are spiced, soft and firm cookies made with whole wheat flour, ginger powder, spices and kakvi (a molasses like syrup made from sugar cane juice).

Thanks so much.\ndassana amit\nMar 20, 2016\nwelcome lavanya. lovely feedback from you and it has definitely made me feel good. thank you much \ud83d\ude42\nShruti\nFeb 01, 2016\nHello. I have tried many of your recepies successfully. Few years back I tried to make cookies but the centre part of the cookie didn\u201dt bake well and the side parts got over-cooked and hardened. Since then I have been reluctant to try cookies. Could you tell me some tips to make the cookies well. Also should the consistency of cookie dough be same as that of chapati dough?\ndassana amit\nFeb 01, 2016\nshruti, the consistency is not like a chapati dough. after reading your comment, it looks like that the dough was kneaded. cookie doughs are just gently mixed. they are not kneaded like the way we knead chapati dough. otherwise the cookies become very hard.\nAshwini\nJan 10, 2016\nHi, Happy new year to you.These cookies tasted like mini gingerbread cakes..Lovely soft texture,but is there anyway I cud get them a bit crisper?\ndassana amit\nJan 10, 2016\npleased to know this ashwini \ud83d\ude42 glad you liked the gingerbread cookies. the recipe will need some tweaking to make them crisp. you could add a few teaspoons more of the butter to get a crisp texture.\nShubha\nDec 28, 2015\nHi \u2026ur recipes r good\u2026being an ayurvedic doctor I always search for healthy recipes..I have tried few of ur recipes\u2026came out well thank u\u2026I need to ask u is it possible to bake cake without using baking soda or powder\u2026.

I want to know which brand of unsalted butter do you use? Also is it possible to use homemade white makkan instead? If yes, should I use the same weight as butter? Thanks\ndassana amit\nDec 27, 2015\nthanks swati. at times i make unsalted butter at home and at times i buy from the parsi dairy. yes you can use homemade makhan. i also use it at times. yes, same weight as that of butter.\nSwati D\nJan 05, 2016\nThanks Dasana for the reply. Will try with homemade makkan. Also would be great if you could post a recipe of how to make butter at home.\ndassana amit\nJan 05, 2016\nthanks swati. i have already added a post on how to make butter at home \u2013 https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/homemade-white-butter-how-to-make-unsalted-white-butter-at-home/ this is an old post and i need to update it with better pics.\nSwati D\nJan 09, 2016\nthat\u2019s great. thanks so much \ud83d\ude42\ndassana amit\nJan 09, 2016\nwelcome swati always \ud83d\ude42\nMarissa\nDec 25, 2015\nI baked these for 12 minutes at 350f in my convection oven.

These will be perfect for a Xmas tea \ud83d\ude42 Thanks for sharing the recipe!\ndassana amit\nDec 22, 2015\ndates syrup will work. but dates syrup will be thick than kakvi. so i suggest adding more hot water towards the end instead of 1/4 cup. depending on the consistency of the dates syrup, you can add 1/3 to 1/2 cup hot water.\nmenu\nHome\nRecipes Index\nBy Ingredients\nBhindi (Okra)\nBrinjal (Eggplant)\nCabbage\nCapsicum\nCauliflower\nChickpeas\nFenugreek\nMushroom\nPaneer Recipes\nGreen Peas\nSpinach\nPotato\nBy Indian Cuisine\nAndhra Recipes\nBengali Recipes\nGoan Recipes\nGujarati Recipes\nHyderabadi Recipes\nKarnataka Recipes\nKashmiri Recipes\nKerala Recipes\nKonkan Recipes\nMaharashtrian Recipes\nNorth Indian Food\nPunjabi Recipes\nSouth Indian Food\nUttar Pradesh Cuisine\nTamil Nadu Recipes\nBreakfast\nEasy Breakfast\nIdli\nDosa Varieties\nParatha Recipes\nSnacks\nStarters & Snacks\nStreet Food\nEvening Snacks\nBread Snacks\nPakora Recipes\nSandwich Recipes\nSweets & Desserts\nBurfi (Fudge)\nCookies\nDesserts\nEggless Cakes\nIce Cream\nHalwa Recipes\nKheer and Payasam\nLadoo Recipes\nSweets\nBeverages\nBeverages\nJuices\nMilkshakes\nSmoothie\nTea & Coffee\nRice\nIndian Rice Recipes\nPulao Recipes\nBiryani Varieties\nMain Course\nVegetables\nCurry\nDal (Lentils) & Legumes\nSambar\nPasta Recipes\nPizza Recipes\nIndian Breads\nIndian Chinese\nBread Recipes\nInstant Pot\nAccompaniments\nChutney Recipes\nPickles\nRaita Recipes\nSalad Recipes\nRasam Varieties\nSoup Recipes\nSpecial Diet\nVegan Recipes\nGluten Free Recipes\nLow Fat Recipes\nSatvik \u2013 No Onion NO Garlic\nNavratri & Fasting Recipes\nDIY\nSpice Mix\nCondiment\nDIY\nAbout\nfree email series\nGet My Secrets to Great Indian Food\nSign up for my FREE Beginners Guide to Delicious Indian Cooking\nFIND A RECIPE\nSearch for:\nNamaste.

This is a step by step recipe to make garlic bread from scratch.\nMy first tryst with Garlic bread happened when we as a team had made these for the first time in our home science cooking lab. One bite of the garlic bread and I was hooked. After that I made garlic bread many times at home.\nGet My Secrets to Great Indian Food\nSign up for my FREE Beginners Guide to Delicious Indian Cooking\nI would especially make these when I would make some soup, like tomato or minestrone soup. Its one bread which my parents liked then and even now.\nThe pics were shot in a hurry as this was one busy day with lots of cooking happening.\u00a0get again ready for a dose of pics to make this awesome garlic bread.\nFlours used in garlic bread\nThe bread is made with whole wheat flour and all purpose flour in the ratio of 2:1 respectively. You can also make the same bread with 1:1 ratio.\nIts much better than the garlic bread we get in cafes or pizzerias. I even made garlic rolls later with the same garlic spread recipe that I used for this bread.\nGarlic butter or spread\nThis garlic spread or garlic butter recipe is from my home science notes.\nI have not used butter here for the garlic spread. I used nutralite \u2013 its a table vegetarian spread and not hydrogenated. However, its not vegan as milk powder is added to the spread. As far as vegan butters are concerned, we don\u2019t get them in India. Atleast I have not seen them in any super store or food store.\nFor cooking and baking, I generally use sunflower, sesame, rice bran or olive oil. There is dalda and margarine available. Since both of them are hydrogenated fats, I don\u2019t use them in cooking or baking.\nNow if you are a vegetarian use butter and if a vegan than a vegan butter or spread, if you can get these in your country.\u00a0\nNote: this recipe is making the garlic bread from scratch and then filling the bread slices with garlic-butter spread. However, you can still make garlic bread without making the bread from scratch. Just get some good quality bread or rolls from out. Slice them and apply the garlic-butter. Bake in the oven. In 20-25 minutes your garlic bread is ready.\nHow to make garlic bread\n1: I decided to roast the garlic bulb on fire for this garlic bread. You can roast it in the oven or just use plain garlic. Either mince the plain garlic or make a paste.\n2: dunk the whole roasted garlic in water. Remove the peels when cooled and mash the garlic in a mortar-pestle.\n3: warm 1 cup water. Stir 1 tbsp sugar and add dry active yeast. Stir & keep in a warm place for 10-15 mins.\n4: the yeast mixture bubbled up.\nMaking garlic bread dough\n5: in a mixing bowl or in a stand mixer fitted with bowl & paddle attachment mix all the dry ingredients first \u2013 both the flours and salt.\n6: add the yeast mixture, oil and the mashed garlic.\n7: knead the dough either with your hands or in the stand mixer if using one.\n8: the dough should be soft and pliable. Apply some water or oil on the whole dough with your palms. Place in a bowl. Cover with a cling film or kitchen towel and keep in a warm place for the dough to leaven for 2:30 to 3 hours.\n9: this is the leavened dough after almost 4 hours.\nBaking garlic bread\n10: Grease a 9 x 4 loaf pan with oil or line with parchment/butter paper. Punch the dough. Roll into a log shape. Seam the edges and place the dough with the seamed edges below, in the loaf pan.\n11: Cover and let the dough rise for 45 mins or 1 hour or more if required.\n12: Bake in a preheated oven for 180 degrees C for 45-55 mins. I forgot to take a pic of the baked bread \ud83d\ude41 once baked, let the bread cool down. Cool the bread on a wire rack.\nMaking garlic butter or spread\n13: in a medium size bowl, take the butter and beat it.\n14: since the quantity of the table spread was less, I chose to beat by spoon rather than using an electric beater. The butter should become light and fluffy. See the difference in both the above pic and this one below.\n15: add the flavorings to the butter \u2013 garlic, celery, black pepper and salt. If using salted butter then no need to add salt. If you like cheese, you can also add some grated cheddar cheese or mozarella or parmesan to the spread. Any type of cheese you like. Vegans can add some nutritional yeast to give that cheesy flavor.\nMaking garlic bread\n16: slice the bread into equal width slices keeping the base intact. Leave half inch space at the base of the bread. Don\u2019t slice through completely. This is bread removed from the fridge and hence it looks dense & dry. I did not even thaw it.\n17: spread the garlic spread on the slices of the bread on both sides.\n18: finish of spreading the garlic butter on all the slices. Apply the remaining butter on top of the bread slices.\n19: preheat the oven at 200 degrees C. Bake for a further 10-15 mins. If you want to brown the edges, you will have to bake for some more time.\nServe\nGarlic bread hot or warm with a good creamy or heavy soup. These slices can also be had plain or they can be served with a pasta dish or as a starter.\nMore Bread recipes\nPita bread\nPizza\nBanana bread\nPaneer pizza\nSTEP BY STEP PHOTOS ABOVE Many of my recipes have detailed step by step photos and useful tips to help you make it easily and perfectly.\nPIN\nPRINT\nGarlic Bread Loaf from scratch\n4.34 from 3 votes\nThis garlic bread is soft, light with a good garlic flavor and taste.\nAuthor: Dassana Amit\nPrep Time: 4\nhrs\nCook Time: 50\nmins\nTotal Time: 4\nhrs\n50\nmins\nCourse: breakfasts,starters\nCuisine: world\nDiet: vegetarian\nServings (change the number to scale): 1\nloaf\n(1 CUP = 250 ML)\nIngredients\nfor the garlic bread\n1\nsmall size garlic bulb\n2\ncups\nwhole wheat flour\n1\ncup\nall purpose flour\n\u00bd\ntablespoon\ndry active yeast\n1\ntablespoon\nsugar\n2\ntablespoon\noil\nor unsalted butter at room temperature\n1\ncup\nwater\n- add 2 or 3 tablespoon water more, if required\n1\nteaspoon\nsalt\nfor the garlic butter\n\u00bd\ncup\nbutter\n(vegan or diary)\n5 to 6\ngarlic\n- finely chopped\n2 to 3\nteaspoon\nfinely chopped celery\nsalt as required\nblack pepper powder as required\nInstructions\npreparation\nRoast the garlic on stove top, grill or oven.\nPeel when cooled and mash the garlic cloves in a mortar-pestle.\u00a0keep aside.\nWarm 1 cup water.\u00a0stir 1 tbsp sugar in the water.\nAdd the dry active yeast.\u00a0stir and keep aside for 10-15 mins.\nmaking garlic bread dough\nMix both the whole wheat & all purpose flour, salt in a bowl or in a mixer stand fitted with a bowl & paddle attachment.\nAdd the oil, mashed garlic and the yeast mixture.\nKnead the dough with your hands or in the stand mixer.

But couldn\u2019t get the second proofing right after being shaped into log and so the baking too got affected. The top crust was very hard and also didn\u2019t swell. What went wrong? Can, using aashirwaad whole wheat flour makes this difference?\ndassana amit\nApr 07, 2016\ndid the bread proof well in the first round. meaning did it rise and double up. if the first rise has gone well, the second should also go well. which size pan did you use. the size of the pan also affects the rise and baking of the bread. also i hope the pan was at room temperature and not hot. while baking, the oven has to be hot. so a preheat time of 15 minutes is required, before you place the pan. crust can become hard due to a high baking temperature in the oven or baked for a longer time.\nPurvi\nApr 07, 2016\nHi, Thanks for replying. Ok didn\u2019t know that size of pan matters too. Its 12\u00d74 inches. Quite a large size I guess. So may be I require double the quantity of dough? Yes first proofing was perfect and loaf pan also wasn\u2019t hot. Baked in a preheated oven.\ndassana amit\nApr 07, 2016\nokay. size of pan matters even while baking cakes. 12\u00d74 inches is a large pan. depth wise is fine but width wise is large. a pan of 7\u00d74 or 8\u00d74 will work very well. for double the quantity you will need a larger pan than 12\u00d74. what i would suggest is to buy a good loaf pan which gives a regular size of bread.\nPurvi\nApr 07, 2016\nOkkay. .thanks a lot:)\nDivya\nFeb 10, 2016\nHi.. could u please tell how much instant yeast can I use instead of dry active one.as I\u2019m more comfortable with it.

It does take a lot of effort into making it. I need a little suggestion in this regard. Is there any other way of doing garlic bread? It need not be as authentic as i get in any cafes or pizzerias. After getting back home from work, if I want to make it, I really cannot afford to do this! Can you suggest an alternative to this \u2013 something quick and less time consuming?\nHope you can suggest something..\nThank you!\ndassana amit\nAug 18, 2015\nhi anjali, what you do is take a loaf of bread (can be whole wheat, brown or multi grain or even white bread). slice in equal parts, keeping 1/2 inch from the base. then spread the garlic butter and bake in the oven till the butter melts. if you want a slight toasted texture, then bake for some more minutes. there is a quick cheese garlic bread also that i make and here is the recipe \u2013 https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/cheese-garlic-bread-recipe/\nAnjali\nAug 20, 2015\nHi Dassana,\nThank you for sharing that link!

Now, on a side note I\u2019d just like to say that I couldn\u2019t but help notice how dry and cake-like your bread looked. I\u2019ve been baking for about 7 years now and I\u2019ve been through the stage where my bread looks very dense and cakey nothing at all like the bread you can buy. I suggest you to use a little more water in your dough and knead it a bit more. The irregularities in the surface and the cakey crumb speak volumes about having been kneaded too little or having too dry a dough. Once again, GREAT recipe. Cheers, John\ndassana\nNov 08, 2013\nthanks. and also thanks for sharing the tips. the bread looks dry, as i had refrigerated it. i did not even thaw the bread. i used it directly right from the fridge while applying the garlic butter (short of time). i know about the water tip and have even experimented some bread with extra water.\nAmber\nSep 20, 2013\nHi. Love this recipe, but I was wondering if I wanted to use only all purpose flour, would it be just 3 cups or do i lessen it?\ndassana\nSep 21, 2013\namber, you can use 3 cups all purpose flour but you might need less amount of water to knead it than the quantity of water mentioned in the recipe.\nanjali\nAug 20, 2013\nThanks a lot Dasna for sharing your very tasty tasty receipes.\ndassana\nAug 20, 2013\nthanks anjali\nShilpa\nJul 02, 2013\nPhenomenal recipie.

These are basically Indian shortbread cookies made with whole wheat flour or atta. I have already posted the Nankhatai made with all-purpose flour or maida.\nWherever possible, I prefer to bake cookies and cakes using whole wheat flour. These whole wheat nankhatai are not as crumbly as the ones made with all-purpose flour but they taste good. Of course, they have the nutty taste of wheat flour.\nGet My Secrets to Great Indian Food\nSign up for my FREE Beginners Guide to Delicious Indian Cooking\nSince they are made from whole wheat flour , they are a better alternative than the one made with all-purpose flour. I have also added besan to give some crumbly texture. If you like to have cookies made with whole wheat flour then you can check these recipes of Butter cookies and Chocolate chip cookies .\nThe recipe yields 300 grams or 14 to 15 medium sized cookies. The recipe can be doubled too.\nMake these whole wheat nankhatai this Diwali and serve them \u00a0as a tea time cookie snack.\nHow to make whole wheat nankhatai\n1. In a grinder jar, take \u2153 cup sugar (70 grams), seeds from 4 to 5 green cardamoms, a pinch of saffron strands and \u215b\u00a0tsp grated nutmeg.\n2. Grind to a fine powder. Keep aside. If you have powdered\u00a0sugar already, then use \u00bd cup of powdered sugar along with \u00bd tsp of cardamom powder, \u215b\u00a0tsp grated nutmeg and crushed saffron strands.\n3. Grease a tray or pan very well with 1 to 2 teaspoon butter or ghee. Also preheat oven to 180 degrees celsius/356 degrees fahrenheit.\u00a0the oven should be preheated 15 minutes before baking.\n4. In a seive, take 1 cup whole wheat flour (atta), 2 tbsp besan and \u00bc tsp baking soda. Add \u00bc tsp baking powder if you do not have baking soda. You can also add a pinch of salt at this step, if using unsalted butter or ghee. If using salted butter then skip adding salt.\u00a0\n5. Sift the dry mixture very well in a mixing bowl or pan.\n6. To the sifted flour mixture add approx \u00bd cup or 70 grams of cold or chilled butter. You can also use \u00bd cup of ghee in semi solid state.\n7. With your fingertips break the butter and mix with the flour.\u00a0you can cut the butter in the flour with two knives too. This can also be achieved with a food processor or a stand mixer.\u00a0if the butter melts while mixing with your hands, then its fine.\n8. Mix till you get a bread crumb like texture in the mixture.\n9. Now add the powdered sugar.\n10. Lightly mix with your hands.\n11. Add 1 to 2 tbsp milk. The amount of milk to be added depends on the quality of flour. The mixture should be able to come together and hold easily. If required you can also add overall 3 to 4 tbsp of milk. I added 2 tbsp milk. Add the milk in parts and mix.\n12. Gently bring together the dough into a ball.\n13.\u00a0 Do not knead the dough . just gently mix and gather the mixture to a dough.\n14. Now pinch small or medium sized balls from the dough and Lightly roll them . place the balls on the greased baking tray.\n15. You can gently press them to flatten them. You can also make designs on them with a fork or toothpick. I used a peda design maker to lightly flatten as well as to give a pattern on the top.\n16. Here is the tray ready to go in the oven. If you want you can sprinkle and lightly press some chopped dry fruits like pistachios, almonds etc from the top.\n17. bake In a pre heated oven at 180 degrees C/356 degrees fahrenheit for 20-25 mins till light golden or golden. Since oven temperatures vary, it may takes less or more time. So do keep a check. Once baked, after 2 to 3 minutes, remove them from the tray and keep on a wire rack for cooling. Don\u2019t brown them too much as then they the crust becomes too dense and hard. A light golden color on the top keeps them soft and crumbly. For convection ovens use the pre heating and baking temperature of 160 degrees celsius/320 degrees fahrenheit.\n18. When cooled at room temperature, store them in an air tight jar. Serve whole wheat nankhatai as a tea time cookie.\nMore Diwali snacks\nKaranji\nChakli\nMurukku\nButter murukku\nShankarpali\nSTEP BY STEP PHOTOS ABOVE Many of my recipes have detailed step by step photos and useful tips to help you make it easily and perfectly.\nPIN\nPRINT\nWhole Wheat Nankhatai\n4.92 from 23 votes\nEasy recipe and method to make Indian shortbread cookies with whole wheat flour.\nAuthor: Dassana Amit\nPrep Time: 5\nmins\nCook Time: 25\nmins\nTotal Time: 30\nmins\nCourse: snacks\nCuisine: north indian\nServings (change the number to scale): 300\ngrams\n(1 CUP = 250 ML)\nIngredients\n1\ncup\nwhole wheat flour\nor 125 grams whole wheat flour\n2\ntablespoon\nbesan\n(gram flour)\n\u00bc\nteaspoon\nbaking soda\nor \u00bc teaspoon baking powder\n1\npinch\nsalt\n- do not add if using salted butter or ghee\n70\ngrams\ncold salted or unsalted butter\n- approx \u00bd cup butter or 70 grams ghee in semi solid state\n\u2153\ncup\nsugar\nor 70 grams sugar or 70 grams powdered sugar or approx \u00bd cup powdered sugar\n4 to 5\ngreen cardamoms\n- crushed lightly to remove the cover and the seeds kept\n1\npinch\nsaffron strands\n\u215b\nteaspoon\ngrated nutmeg\nor nutmeg powder\n1 to 2\ntablespoon\nmilk\n1 to 2\nteaspoon\nbutter\nor ghee for greasing baking tray\nInstructions\nmaking dough\nIn a grinder jar, take 1/3 cup sugar (70 grams), seeds from 4 to 5 green cardamoms, a pinch of safron strands and 1/8 tsp grated nutmeg.\nGrind to a fine powder.

No other person writes in so much detail as you so it\u2019s extremely helpful for beginners like me !\nI don\u2019t know the difference between oven and convection oven I think I have a convection oven it looks just like microwave oven but is named as convection oven I have both microwave oven and convection oven.\nDoes baking in convection oven turn out exactly same as in the baking oven? What is the difference? Can I bake all the cookies recipes and cakes recipes in convection oven with same result as baking oven or to get perfect baking I should bake in baking oven only?\ndassana amit\nJul 19, 2019\nthank you meha. microwave oven cooking is due to the microwave radiations which cook the food. convection oven cook food by convection and conduction of heat. the heat is transmitted by heating rods. in a microwave oven, the heating rods are placed on top. so the heat comes from top and helps in baking.\nit is better to get the company person to demonstrate the various modes of the oven and also for information on the type of pan material to be used. steel or metal pans cannot be used in the microwave mode as arcing happens. it is risky.\nbaking in convection oven turns out the same as baking in a regular oven. there is no difference. it is just that time taken to bake in convection ovens is less as the baking is quick. yes, you can bake cake or cookies in a convection oven. you can bake any cake or cookies perfectly in a convection oven. but just do not use a combination mode or microwave mode. only use the convection mode when baking.\nMeha\nJul 19, 2019\nHello thanks for the recipe! I only have convection oven can I make all the cookie and cake recipes in convection oven ?\ndassana amit\nJul 19, 2019\nyes you can easily make any cake, cookie or bread recipes in a convection oven. convection ovens have a fan, so the baking is quick in them. so either decrease the temperature by 10 to 15 degrees celsius or decrease the time of baking.\nManisha Pandya\nFeb 04, 2019\nHello ma\u2019am. Awesome recipe. My mom and brother loves these cookies a lot. But in market we mostly get made of maida. But they loved wheat nankhatai a lot and a lot. Thanks a ton. My question is as they both are diabetic can you please help me with some suggestions for it.\ndassana\nFeb 04, 2019\nthanks manisha for this feedback. using the same recipe you can make namkeen khatais like adding jeera or ajwain, salt and spice powders. this way you don\u2019t need to add any sugar. another option is to use a fruit based puree like an apple puree and skip sugar. but with a fruit puree the texture can be soft.\njudith\nOct 31, 2018\nHi Dassana, please tell mi what is besan, and where can i find it? Thank you\ndassana amit\nOct 31, 2018\njudith, besan is gram flour made from husked black & split chickpeas. you can use chickpea flour instead. chickpea flour will be easily available in any grocery stores in US. you will get besan in indian grocery stores.\nComment navigation\n\u2190 Older Comments\nmenu\nHome\nRecipes Index\nBy Ingredients\nBhindi (Okra)\nBrinjal (Eggplant)\nCabbage\nCapsicum\nCauliflower\nChickpeas\nFenugreek\nMushroom\nPaneer Recipes\nGreen Peas\nSpinach\nPotato\nBy Indian Cuisine\nAndhra Recipes\nBengali Recipes\nGoan Recipes\nGujarati Recipes\nHyderabadi Recipes\nKarnataka Recipes\nKashmiri Recipes\nKerala Recipes\nKonkan Recipes\nMaharashtrian Recipes\nNorth Indian Food\nPunjabi Recipes\nSouth Indian Food\nUttar Pradesh Cuisine\nTamil Nadu Recipes\nBreakfast\nEasy Breakfast\nIdli\nDosa Varieties\nParatha Recipes\nSnacks\nStarters & Snacks\nStreet Food\nEvening Snacks\nBread Snacks\nPakora Recipes\nSandwich Recipes\nSweets & Desserts\nBurfi (Fudge)\nCookies\nDesserts\nEggless Cakes\nIce Cream\nHalwa Recipes\nKheer and Payasam\nLadoo Recipes\nSweets\nBeverages\nBeverages\nJuices\nMilkshakes\nSmoothie\nTea & Coffee\nRice\nIndian Rice Recipes\nPulao Recipes\nBiryani Varieties\nMain Course\nVegetables\nCurry\nDal (Lentils) & Legumes\nSambar\nPasta Recipes\nPizza Recipes\nIndian Breads\nIndian Chinese\nBread Recipes\nInstant Pot\nAccompaniments\nChutney Recipes\nPickles\nRaita Recipes\nSalad Recipes\nRasam Varieties\nSoup Recipes\nSpecial Diet\nVegan Recipes\nGluten Free Recipes\nLow Fat Recipes\nSatvik \u2013 No Onion NO Garlic\nNavratri & Fasting Recipes\nDIY\nSpice Mix\nCondiment\nDIY\nAbout\nfree email series\nGet My Secrets to Great Indian Food\nSign up for my FREE Beginners Guide to Delicious Indian Cooking\nFIND A RECIPE\nSearch for:\nNamaste.

We love to dip biscuits in our tea and have time.\u00a0for kids, the biscuits are dipped in milk. Like most biscuits, these tutti frutti cookies are also an awesome tea time snack. Since we are approaching christmas and new year, I though of sharing the recipe. This is the first time I made these cookies and have adapted them from a book on industrial baking.\nGet My Secrets to Great Indian Food\nSign up for my FREE Beginners Guide to Delicious Indian Cooking\nThese cookies can be stored at room temperature for about a month . the recipe yields about 475 grams of cookies or 60 to 62 biscuits. Quite a large batch. The recipe can also be halved proportionately and you can make a small batch of cookies.\nThe method used to make the cookies is the butter+sugar creaming technique. You can use a handheld electric mixer, food processor or even as stand mixer to do this. Apart from tutti frutti, you can also add chopped dry fruits and nuts. The texture of the cookies is crisp, flaky and a bit crumbly.\nThese egg free tutti frutti cookies would also make a nice gift to family or friends.\nHow to make tutti frutti cookies\n1. Firstly take \u00bd cup of sugar in a dry grinder.\n2. Grind to a fine powder. You can also use \u00bd cup icing sugar instead. Keep aside.\n3. Grease a baking tray with some butter.\n4. In a mixing bowl take \u00be cup softened butter (140 grams butter).\n5. Add the powdered sugar.\n6. With a beater, cream the butter and sugar till the mixture becomes light and fluffy.\n7. On\u00a0a medium speed, it took me about 4 to 5 minutes to cream the butter and sugar till smooth and light.\n8. Here\u2019s a pic of the creamed butter and sugar.\u00a0also\u00a0preheat your oven to 180 degrees celsius/356 degrees fahrenheit. The oven should be preheated 15 minutes before baking.\n9. Now add 1 tsp vanilla extract or vanilla essence. You can also use \u00bd tsp cardamom powder or \u00bc tsp nutmeg powder, if you do not have vanilla extract. Also rose essence or extract can be added. In fact you can add any fruit extract or essence.\n10. Fold the vanilla extract with the creamed mixture.\n11. Next directly sift 2 cups whole wheat flour or atta (240 grams) directly in the bowl containing the creamed butter. You can also sift the flour in a plate and then add. Instead of whole wheat flour, you can also use all purpose flour or maida or half-half of both the flours.\n12. Now add 3 to 4 tbsp milk. I added 4 tbsp. Depending on the quality of flour you may need to add more or less milk. The milk helps in binding and to get the mixture together in a dough.\n13. Begin to gently mix with your hands.\n14. Mixing gently, gather the whole mixture in a dough. Do not knead .\u00a0the mixture should be able to come together and hold easily. Add 1 or 2 tbsp more of the milk if the dough is not able to come together in a dough.\u00a0if in case, the dough becomes sticky, then sprinkle some flour evenly all over and gently mix again.\nRolling tutti frutti cookies\n15. Now roll the dough gently having a width of 0.5 cm at the edges.\n16. Sprinkle 4 to 5 tbsp tutti frutti evenly on the rolled cookie dough.\n17. Gently press the tutti frutti so that they get embedded in the dough.\n18. With a biscuit cutter, cut the cookie slices.\nBaking tutti frutti cookies\n19. Gently remove them and place on the greased baking tray. These tutti frutti cookies are light and soft, so do remove gently and carefully without breaking them.\n20. Bake in the preheated oven at\u00a0180 degrees C/356 degrees fahrenheit for 15-20 mins till the tops become light golden. Since oven temperatures vary, it may takes less or more time. So do keep a check.\u00a0 For convection ovens use the preheating and baking temperature of 160 degrees celsius/320 degrees fahrenheit. In an OTG, keep the tray on the center rack with both the top and bottom heating elements on.\n21. Bake till the cookies are a light or pale golden. Do not over bake them as then they will become very hard. Here\u2019s a closer look of the cookies.\n22. The base should also be light golden to golden as you see in the picture below. I baked in two batches as I have a small oven. If you have a big oven, you can bake these tutti frutti cookies in one go.\n23. After a minute, place them on a wired rack. Let them cool at room temperature. Once cooled, store them in an air-tight box or jars.\n24. Serve the\u00a0tutti frutti cookies \u00a0as a dessert snack or tea time snack.\nFew more tasty recipes for you!\nButter cookies\nCoconut cookies\nNankhatai recipe\nBhakarwadi recipe\nChocolate chip cookies\nSTEP BY STEP PHOTOS ABOVE Many of my recipes have detailed step by step photos and useful tips to help you make it easily and perfectly.\nPIN\nPRINT\ntutti frutti cookies\n4.85 from 13 votes\nCrisp tutti frutti cookies made with whole wheat flour or atta.\nAuthor: Dassana Amit\nPrep Time: 45\nmins\nCook Time: 20\nmins\nTotal Time: 1\nhr\n5\nmins\nCourse: desserts\nCuisine: world\nDiet: vegetarian\nServings (change the number to scale): 475\ngrams\n(1 CUP = 250 ML)\nIngredients\n240\ngrams\nwhole wheat flour\nor 2 cups whole wheat flour\n140\ngrams\nbutter\nor \u00be cup softened butter\n100\ngrams\nsugar\nor \u00bd cup sugar or \u00bd cup powdered sugar or icing sugar\n1\nteaspoon\nvanilla extract\n35 to 40\ngrams\ntutti frutti\nor 4 to 5 tablespoon tutti frutti (candied raw papaya pieces)\n3 to 4\ntablespoon\nmilk\nor add as required\nsome butter for greasing the baking tray\nInstructions\nmaking tutti frutti cookies dough\nFirstly take 1/2 cup sugar in a dry grinder.\nGrind to a fine powder.

The method of making these tasty cookies is different and very easy. Butter is cut in the flour and this method gives the cookies a crunchy texture. Rolled oats give a chewy texture.\nRaisins also give a nice sweet-tangy taste along with a chewy texture. You can skip raisins if you want. For a softer texture in the cookies you can add a pinch of baking soda.\nFor kids, serve these best oatmeal cookies with hot or warm milk. For adults serve them with tea or coffee.\nHow to make oatmeal raisins cookies\nPreparation:\n1. Take\u00a0\u2153 cup sugar (60 grams) in a grinder jar.\n2. Powder finely. Keep aside.\n3. Grease a pan or tray with some butter and keep aside. Also preheat oven at 180 degrees celsius for 15 minutes. If using an OTG, then use both the top and heating elements on (toast mode). For convection ovens also you can preheat at 180 degrees celsius for 15 minutes.\nMaking oatmeal cookie dough\n4. Take \u00bd cup whole wheat flour or atta (85 grams) in a mixing bowl. Also add\u00a0\u2153\u00a0cup chilled unsalted butter (50 grams).\n5. With a knife cut the butter in flour and make a bread crumb like texture in flour. You can also use your fingertips to mix the cold butter in the flour till the mixture resembles a bread crumb like texture. Alternatively, a stand mixer also can be used. If the butter starts melting, then keep the mixture in the fridge for 20 to 30 minutes.\n6. Next add the powdered sugar.\n7. Then add \u00bc teaspoon cinnamon powder and \u00bc teaspoon vanilla extract. You can also add\u00a0\u215b teaspoon vanilla essence instead of vanilla extract.\n8. Mix very well.\n9. Next add \u00bd cup rolled oats or quick-cooking oats (60 grams) and 2 tablespoons golden raisins.\n10. Mix again well.\n11. Now add 2 to 4 tablespoons chilled (cold) milk in parts. The amount of milk to be added will depend on the type and quality of whole wheat flour. So add accordingly.\n12. Mix and bring the mixture together so that it binds into a dough. Do not knead.\n13. Just add enough milk in parts to mix and bind the mixture very well. The cookie dough will be sticky.\n14. Now scoop out the dough with a tablespoon or any spoon.\n15. Place the scooped dough on the greased tray. Keep some space of about 1.5 to 2 inches between the cookies.\n16. Make cookies this way with the entire cookie dough. While working on the cookies, do note that the dough is sticky.\n17. Now gently press the top of each oatmeal cookie with a spatula just to even it and make it smooth.\nBaking oatmeal cookies\n18. Place the cookie tray in the preheated oven in the center rack of an OTG. Bake oats cookies at 180 degrees celsius for 25 to 30 minutes or till the cookies become light golden. Do not over bake them or make them too much golden as then oats cookies will become hard. A way to test is with a spoon or fork press the top of the cookie. It should not create any impression on it . since oven temperatures vary do keep a check. in my oven it took 30 minutes for the cookies to bake. The timing can be less or more than 30 minutes and this depends on the oven model, size and heating type.\n19. Keep the tray outside for 2 to 3 minutes.\n20. Then with a spatula remove the oats cookie and place them on a wired rack till they are cooled completely at room temperature.\n21. Here\u2019s a pic of the base of the oatmeal cookie. It should have a golden texture like this.\n22. Once cooled then store oatmeal cookies in an airtight jar.

You can add 1/4th to 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon powder.\nSrilekha\nJun 16, 2019\nHi dassana, thanks for this lovely and healthy recipe, I have a doubt, in convection otg which mode should I use (both bottom and top rod on or only bottom rods on)\ndassana amit\nJun 17, 2019\nBoth the top and bottom rods can be used and give better results\nGeethaDevendran\nMar 30, 2019\nCan we use peanut butter (crunchy) instead of regular butter?\ndassana amit\nMar 30, 2019\nyou can try. but with peanut butter the taste and texture will be different.\nMichelle\nMar 25, 2019\nHi,\nAt what temperature and for how long will I need to bake these in a convection microwave?\ndassana\nMar 25, 2019\nin the convection mode of microwave oven preheat as well as bake for 170 degrees celsius.\nApurva\nMar 23, 2019\nHi Dassana, can chocolate chips be used in this recipe instead of raisins?

I needed an oatmeal cookie recipe for so long and this is even the cherry on cake as it has no baking powder or soda How better can healthy be defined Again Thanku I just had one query can we make it more healthier by adding gur powder like you added in the coconut biscuit recipe ????\ndassana amit\nFeb 20, 2018\nthanks amandeep. yes of course you can add jaggery powder. but taste and texture will be different with jaggery powder. jaggery will give some moistness in the cookies.\nKhaitan\nFeb 01, 2018\nSuperb recipe turned out great. But the raisins turned black which I see also in your picture. Anything I can do to avoid that? Also can I replace sugar and butter with jaggery powder and ghee or olive oil ? If yes then what would be the quantity required. Thank you\ndassana amit\nFeb 01, 2018\nthanks khaitan. the color or raisins will change as they will get caramelized due to the baking. at the most if you see any raisin on top of the cookie, then remove it and keep it inside the cookie. you can also skip raisins. you can use ghee or olive oil and even jaggery powder. with oil or ghee and jaggery powder the texture will be soft and the taste will be different. jaggery you can take the same amount as that of sugar. oil you can take about \u00bc cup. ghee can be \u2153 cup.\nKhaitan\nJan 30, 2018\nHi I wanted to know if I could use jaggery powder instead of sugar powder and if yes how much quantity to use? Also can I use olive oil instead of butter?\ndassana amit\nJan 30, 2018\nKhaitan, use the same amount of jaggery. Yes you can use olive oil.\nJinal\nJan 04, 2018\nHi Dassana, How can I make the cookies soft and chewy instead of crisp. I want to make these for my toddler who only has 4 teeth \ud83d\ude42 Please advise! Thank you!\ndassana amit\nJan 04, 2018\njinal, for soft cookies, do not add butter. add oil. then like we do for samosa or kachori dough, mix the oil with the flour till you get a breadcrumb like consistency. also add some more milk and make a softer and more sticky cookie dough consistency. generally for softer and cake like cookies baking soda is added, but for a toddler i would not advise addition of baking soda or baking powder. some apple sauce or banana puree added in the cookie will also make them soft. in case you add apple sauce or banana puree, then reduce the sugar and reduce the amount of milk.\ndassana amit\nJan 04, 2018\njinal, for soft cookies, do not add chilled butter. you can add melted butter or add oil. if using oil, then add \u00bc cup. melted butter can be \u00bc to \u2153 cup. you can add then like we do for samosa or kachori dough, mix the oil with the flour till you get a breadcrumb like consistency. also add some more milk and make a softer and more sticky cookie dough consistency. generally for softer and cake like cookies baking soda is added, but for a toddler i would not advise addition of baking soda or baking powder. some apple sauce or banana puree added in the cookie will also make them soft. in case you add apple sauce or banana puree, then reduce the sugar and reduce the amount of milk.\nJinal\nJan 11, 2018\nThank you soo much! Will give it a try and get back to you.\ndassana amit\nJan 11, 2018\nWelcome Jinal\nAnjana\nDec 21, 2017\nOk Dassana i will try again. I especially liked that you dint use chemicals like baking powder and baking soda in these cookies and they still turned out great! Please continue posting such healthy cookies! \ud83d\ude42\ndassana amit\nDec 21, 2017\nthanks anjana. depending on the recipe one can give baking powder and baking soda a miss. however usually in eggless cakes both these two ingredients are needed. if only eggs were used, then these two ingredients can be given a skip. sure, i will try to add more such recipes.\nAnjana\nDec 20, 2017\nHi Dassana my were a bit crispy on the day i baked them but got soft the next day. What did i do wrong? They still taste yum though!! Thank you \ud83d\ude42\ndassana amit\nDec 20, 2017\nWelcome Anjana. When you store the oats cookies then they should be completely cooled at room temperature. if the cookies are slightly hot or warm and you store them, then the cookies will become soft due to the moisture from condensation.\nAnjana\nDec 05, 2017\nHi dassana looks yum! Can this recipe be doubled?\ndassana amit\nDec 06, 2017\nThanks Anjana.

Soft, moist and delicious eggless cake made without oven and in a pressure cooker.\nOne of the recipe requests I have got many times is on How to make cake without oven . so thought of adding the recipe.\nGet My Secrets to Great Indian Food\nSign up for my FREE Beginners Guide to Delicious Indian Cooking\nI have made this cake many times in an oven . when I had first made this cake, I had made it in the pressure cooker. This recipe is roughly adapted from a cake recipe which I have been making many years back.\nThe recipe is simple and you do not need any special ingredients. this eggless cake is made with all purpose flour (maida) . do use if possible organic maida or unbleached all purpose flour. You can also prepare this cake with whole wheat flour (atta) as I have made it before with atta. You may need to add some more water if using atta. I will try to share the atta version of this cake too. You can also check this Wheat cake recipe .\nThe cake is soft, moist and light and tastes like dutch truffle cake . basically this cake is best had directly from the pan. It is so moist that even when you slice you have to slice carefully and only once the icing sets. Even without icing the cake tastes good, but I do recommend the chocolate icing, to get the real deal.\nCake recipes without oven\nCooker cake \u2013 spongy and a soft, light-textured delicious egg-free sponge cake recipe made in a pressure cooker.\nBiscuit cake \u2013 this is one of the easiest and yummy cake recipe one can make. This no bake biscuit cake has chocolate in it and tastes too good.\nCucumber cake \u2013 a light, nutritious steamed cake made with yellow cucumber, semolina, jaggery and coconut. A traditional recipe from the Goan belt and is called as\u00a0tavsali. In this recipe the cake is steamed instead of baking it.\nThis cake can also be made in the oven ( Details mentioned in the recipe card & the step by step pics below ). The recipe uses curd and vinegar. You can also use buttermilk instead of curd. Do use any good quality cocoa powder.\u00a0i have used hershey\u2019s cocoa powder.\nHow to make cake without oven\n1. Grease a baking pan or baking bowl with butter or oil. Do make sure that the pan you use should fit inside a 5 or 6 litre pressure cooker.\n2. In a bowl, take\u00a01 cup all purpose flour (125 grams) and\u00a0\u00bc teaspoon salt.\n3. Then add \u00bd cup sugar (100 grams).\n4. Mix everything very well with a spoon or wired whisk. Keep aside.\n5. Then in a pan, take \u00bc cup unsalted butter (30 grams), \u00bc cup oil and \u00bc cup cocoa powder (20 grams).\u00a0if using salted butter then skip adding salt in step 1.\n6. Add\u00a0\u00bd cup water.\n7. Keep the pan on a low flame and with a wired whisk, continuously stir so that all the cocoa powder dissolves and the mixture becomes uniform. There should be no lumps.\n8. The butter will start melting on a low heat.\n9. Bring just to a boil over medium heat, stirring continuously with the whisk.\n10. As soon as the chocolate mixture comes to a boil, immediately pour it into the flour mixture.\n11. Just light mix. If you don\u2019t mix, then also its fine. Keep aside.\n12. In a 5 or 6 litre cooker, spread 1 cup salt evenly. Place the cooker on a low flame.\n13. In another small bowl, take \u00bc cup fresh curd.\n14. Add \u00bc cup water to the curd.\n15. Mix very well.\n16. Then add 1 teaspoon vinegar to it. Mix again.\n17. Next add 1 teaspoon vanilla extract or \u00bd teaspoon vanilla essence.\n18. Lastly add \u00bd teaspoon baking soda. Since only baking soda is used, do make sure that the baking soda is fresh and active. To check the freshness, just dissolve a bit of baking soda in solution of vinegar and water and it should fizz and bubble.\n19. Mix very well. This mixture will begin to froth.\n20. Immediately add this mixture to the flour+chocolate mixture.\nMixing and making cake without oven\n21. With a wired whisk mix very well.\n22. However do not over do the mixing.\n23. Pour into the greased baking tin.\n24.\u00a0gently shake the pan.\n25. Place a rack or stand on the salt layer.\n26. Place the cake pan on the stand.\n27. Close with the cooker\u2019s lid. The rubber gasket (rubber ring) and the whistle should be removed.\n28. Bake the cake for 40 to 45 minutes on a low flame. If baking in an oven, then bake in a preheated oven at 180 degree celsius/350 degrees fahrenheit for 35 to 40 minutes.\n29. Check with a toothpick to see if the cake is done or not. The toothpick should come out clean. In fact, even after 20 to 25 minutes, you can open the lid and check to see if the cake is done or not.\n30. Remove the cake pan carefully from the pressure cooker. While the cake is still hot. Poke a lot of holes in it using a fork or a toothpick or a wooden skewer. Make a lot of holes as this is where the icing seeps into and they cannot be seen once the icing has been cooled.\nTo make the icing\n1. In a saucepan, take \u00bc cup butter, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract or \u00bd teaspoon vanilla essence, 10 tablespoons brown sugar, \u00bc cup milk and \u00bc cup cocoa powder. Instead of brown sugar, you can also use regular white sugar or unrefined cane sugar.\n2. Keep the pan on a low flame and with a wired whisk stir very well.\n3. The sugar should melt and the cocoa powder should dissolve. Keep on stirring continuously to get an even mixture.\n4.\u00a0bring this mixture to a boil.\n5. Once this icing mixture comes to a boil, then immediately pour it all over the cake. You don\u2019t need to spread it as the icing seeps down inside the cake.\n6. This cake tastes good warm also, but you cannot slice them and you can just have it directly from the pan. You can also cool the cake in the fridge and then have it. Cover the pan with a lid or foil when keeping in the fridge. I kept the cake in the fridge and thus I was able to slice them for the final pics \ud83d\ude42\n7. Slice and then serve the cake as a\u00a0dessert.\nMore Cake recipes for you!\nChocolate cake\nBlack forest cake\nChoco lava cake\nBanana cake\nSTEP BY STEP PHOTOS ABOVE Many of my recipes have detailed step by step photos and useful tips to help you make it easily and perfectly.\nPIN\nPRINT\nHow to Make Cake Without Oven\n4.84 from 49 votes\nThis recipe is of an eggless cake recipe in a pressure cooker.

Can u plz tell me how to prevent this.\ndassana amit\nMay 24, 2019\nhi shubha, the bitterness could be due to the quality of cocoa powder or butter. icing has turned hard as it was cooked more and thus the sugar has got cooked too much. the sugar on cooling thus has crystallized and hence the icing being hard. just cook icing till it begins to boil and then immediately remove from fire. cook the icing mixture on a low to medium-low flame. use a good quality cocoa powder. for the butter do check its aroma. if the aroma is slightly stale or not fresh, then avoid adding this butter as it will give a bitter taste in the cake. hope these suggestions help.\nbaker\nMar 30, 2019\nHi Dassana,\nThe cake looks very good, and I wanted to try making i. I just wanted to ask why do you have to put the cake pan on top of a salt layer?\ndassana amit\nMar 31, 2019\njust to provide a layer so that the cake does not get burnt. thanks.\nhamsa\nOct 22, 2018\nHi Dassana,\nI mostly visit your website first to check out recipes that I need. I really appreciate your candid manner of writing and the efforts you put in to photograph and publish the recipes so beautifully. Im very new to baking. I prepared the cooker cake in an electric cooker, just for trial and it turned out really well! Also got appreciations, thanks to you. I\u2019m glad that the comments section is easily available now. I\u2019ll keep coming back!\ndassana amit\nOct 24, 2018\nthanks a lot hamsa. so glad to read your comment. yes we had removed the comments section as we were having some technical issues which we were not able to solve for a few months. sure, you can always give feedback or share any concerns or issues if you had with any recipe.\nHamsa\nAug 06, 2019\nHi Dassana, I\u2019m planning to make this again but in greater quantity. Please let me know whether this recipe can be doubled.\ndassana amit\nAug 06, 2019\nhi hamsa, you can double this recipe. it will take more time to bake.\nShikha\nFeb 16, 2018\nHello mam plz tell me white sugar quantity measurement according to cup\ndassana amit\nFeb 16, 2018\nuse the same measurement as mentioned in the recipe which is \u00bd cup sugar and 10 tablespoons white sugar for icing.\nPallavi Bhargava\nFeb 14, 2018\nThe cake came out very well but it was very bitter if eaten without an ice cream. Sugar ratio is not right for this much cocoa powder I think. But otherwise the softness and overall came out very well.\ndassana amit\nFeb 14, 2018\npallavi bitterness could be due to the type and quality of cocoa powder used and butter. for butter if it becomes rancid, then the cake will become butter. the amount of cocoa powder is not much, so i don\u2019t think cocoa powder is the cause. while making cakes with butter always use fresh butter. it should have any off smell or a rancid smell. the taste should be sweet like butter and not bitter. bitterness can also be due to oil. oils like cold pressed peanut oil or sesame oil can give a bitter taste. sugar proportion is right for this recipe as icing is also added. curd can also be bitter if it is old and not fresh.\nPallavi Bhargava\nFeb 15, 2018\nThank you for the response.\ndassana amit\nFeb 16, 2018\nWelcome Pallavi\nSheena\nJan 28, 2018\nAmazing recipe.

For the icing, can I prepare less icing mixture so that the cake doesn\u2019t become too moist? Looking forward for your reply.

The smell is kind of rubbery or something of the cooker, I can\u2019t figure it out. Any advice on this?. I used an Aluminium cooker and tin with salt at the base as given. I changed the cooker and the tin the second time I baked, but the same old smell again. \ud83d\ude41\ndassana amit\nOct 02, 2017\ncould be due to the tin or aluminium or the pan you are using. i suspect it is the pan which is used for baking. use a good quality aluminium pan which are actually meant for baking.\nShruthi\nOct 05, 2017\nAlright. Thanks a lot!. I noticed that the smell was gone the next day.

Hi there,\nI love indian recipes, so thank you for your side, that now belong to my beloved too.\nIs it possible to cook the cake in a rice steamer? Since I got no pressure cooker and no oven (got a single student household). The most I would love to know how to make it in a pot, because yet I don\u2019t owe a rice cooker, but am thinking a long time if it worth buying one and for tasty cakes SURE\nThank you\ndassana amit\nJul 04, 2017\nanna, i do not know how the texture of cake will be if cooked in a rice steamer. but you can use a large pot to cook this cake. just follow the same method as sprinkling salt on the base. keep a stand and keep the pan on the stand. cover the pot with a lid having a vent, so that steam passes through. also do use a heavy and good quality pot.\nNikita S\nMay 30, 2017\nHi, I made this cake and it came out very well. Fabulous recipe. It was soft and sweet all in appropriate amount. Just that \u2013 I had lined the mould with butter paper to be able to take out cake easily and I had kept the cake in fridge overnight in the mould itself. But even on the next day when I tried to take the cake out of the mould, the chocolate syrup wouldn\u2019t leave the butter paper. Opening the paper didn\u2019t spoil the cake much but it sure looked like chocolate design was all around the cake (due to semi-solidified chocolate syrup), and didn\u2019t look much pleasing. Any suggestions to be able to present this cake better?\nThanks for your recipe!\ndassana amit\nMay 30, 2017\nthanks nikita. the chocolate syrup won\u2019t leave the butter paper as it is not a thick chocolate syrup or a chocolate ganache. i would suggest not to use butter paper. the cake is also moist and soft, so if it is removed from the pan while still hot, it will break. basically this is like a pan cake, where the cake is had directly from the pan. so just don\u2019t use butter paper.\nDr. Nehal Mohata\nMay 20, 2017\nHi\u2026 thanku very much.. for the 1 st time I tried cake and it was superb..it was very soft n yummy.. ur recipe is very well explained..

Mashed potatoes are a family favorite and it was time I shared the recipe. There are so many versions of mashed potato recipes on the web. The recipe that I make is a homely, easy and one bowl recipe. You don\u2019t need special appliances or special ingredients to make this one.\nThis recipe of mashed potatoes yields comforting, smooth and fluffy mashed potatoes that you would like to make again and again.\nGet My Secrets to Great Indian Food\nSign up for my FREE Beginners Guide to Delicious Indian Cooking\nHow to make mashed potatoes (basic recipe)\nA basic mashed potato recipe is just made with potatoes, milk, butter, salt and pepper. The potatoes are cooked till tender. The cooked potatoes are then strained and mashed. Warm milk, butter, salt and pepper are added to the mashed potatoes. You can build upon this basic recipe by adding various herbs, greens, seasonings and spices.\nWhat about this mashed potatoes recipe\nIf you want a mashed potato recipe that gives a fluffy texture, then make this recipe and you will absolutely love it. I have noted down below the ingredients and their roles in the recipe. I generally make enough quantity of mashed potatoes so that there are no leftovers. Yet, one can easily half or double or triple this recipe and make it for small parties or gatherings.\nGarlic \u2013 in my mashed potato recipe, I add a bit of garlic as it gives that light pungent flavor and taste to the mashed potatoes. I have made mashed potatoes without garlic too and I always felt some flavor profile lacking \u2013 as if something is not complete or missing in the flavors.\nHerbs \u2013 personally I prefer to use fresh herbs, but not at all times one can have access to fresh herbs. Same is the case with me. I make mashed potatoes both with fresh herbs and dried herbs and both taste good. However, with fresh herbs the taste is better. That said, adding herbs can be simply skipped if you are not a fan of herbs or you don\u2019t have them in your kitchen.\nBlack pepper \u2013 when it comes to black pepper, freshly crushed black pepper is on top of the game as compared to black pepper powder. So please please use freshly crushed black pepper in this mashed potatoes recipe. You can use a pepper mill to crush the peppers or crush them semi-fine in a mortar-pestle which hardly takes time.\nFat \u2013 you can use both butter or extra virgin olive oil (evoo). I have made mashed potatoes with both on various occasions and both work fine.\nMilk \u2013 for a rich creamy version, I suggest using whole milk. For a vegan mashed potato, coconut milk or almond milk works well. With coconut milk, you will get the coconut taste in the mashed potatoes.\nTips to get the best of mashed potatoes\nType of potatoes \u2013 use potatoes having medium to high starch. Potatoes with high starch content like russet potatoes work very well and will yield fluffy mashed potatoes. For Indian readers, most varieties of Indian potatoes have good starch in them. Just avoid using new potatoes. I make mashed potatoes with organic potatoes (Indian variety) and these are similar to russet potatoes (since I make even french fries, roasted potato, potato wedges with these). So for mashed potatoes, I get a fluffy texture whenever I make them. With french fries or potato wedges, I get a crisp texture with a nice light soft texture from inside.\nBoiling potatoes \u2013 boil the potatoes till tender, but do not overcook them. They should be cooked well and fork-tender. If they are cooked till crumbly, then some water will log in them causing the mashed potatoes to have a watery taste and consistency.\nMashing potatoes \u2013 avoid using a stand mixer while mashing, as at times the mixer might over mix the potatoes. This will break down the starches leading to a gluey and sticky consistency. It is better to use a potato masher. If the potatoes are cooked perfectly, it becomes easy to mash them with a potato masher or a vegetable masher.\nTexture of mashed potatoes \u2013 the final texture of mashed potatoes should be light and fluffy or creamy. This will depend on the type of potato you have used. For a fluffy texture, use potatoes that have high starch in them eg russet, or idaho potatoes. For creamy and slightly dense texture, use potatoes with medium starch eg yukon gold. You can even use both a mix of russet and yukon gold.\nWater-logging in potatoes \u2013 always drain the water very well after the potatoes are cooked. If there is even slight water, the taste and consistency both get affected. You will get a watery taste in the potatoes and the flavors will be diluted.\nRole of fats \u2013\u00a0both fats like butter or evoo need to be added. Do not skip them as they help in making the mashed potatoes, light and smooth.\nAdding cheese or cream \u2013 I usually do not add grated cheese or cream, but you can. If using cream then heat it gently with butter but do not bring it to a boil if using cheese then sprinkle on the mashed potatoes. Bake in the oven till the cheese melts or gets golden. Adding either cream of cheese will give you a rich-tasting mashed potato.\nCooking potatoes in a pressure cooker \u2013 most of the times, I cook the potatoes in a pressure cooker. For this recipe post, I have used a pan. So that the recipe can be easily made by folks who do not have a pressure cooker.\u00a0 if pressure cooking, then cook for 2 whistles on medium flame.\nTo peel or not to peel \u2013 I always suggest peeling the potatoes. Keeping the peels might give an unpleasant taste and texture in the mashed potatoes. It is a personal preference and if you like the peels, then keep them on.\nServing suggestions with mashed potatoes\nI always serve mashed potatoes with some roasted vegetables and a bowl of soup like corn soup, tomato soup or carrot soup. Below are some vegetarian options you can consider.\nRoasted vegetables\nSteamed vegetables\nVegetable salad\nGrilled vegetables\nCreamed spinach\nVegetarian or vegan stroganoff\nCreamed corn\nA hearty vegetable soup\nMarinated & grilled tofu or paneer (cottage cheese).\nHow to make mashed potatoes\n1. Rinse 500 grams of potatoes in water first using a colander. Brush off any mud if any. Rinse really well. Drain the water and then peel the potatoes.\n2. Chop them in 1.5 to 2 inches cubes.\n3. Place chopped potatoes in a pan (3 litres or 3 quarts size). Add \u00bd teaspoon salt.\n4. Pour 2 cups water and stir. The water should just about cover the potatoes. Add water more or less depending on the size of the pan.\nCooking potatoes\n5. Cover the pan. Keep the pan on a stovetop on a medium-low to medium flame for the potatoes to cook.\n6. While the potatoes are cooking, check at intervals. Meanwhile, you can chop garlic and the fresh herbs if using them.\n7. The potatoes have to be softened, but they should not fall apart. The potatoes will take about 20 to 25 minutes to cook depending on the size of the pan, the thickness of pan and the intensity of the flame.\n8. Check by piercing a knife or a fork and it should pass through the cooked potatoes without any resistance and smoothly.\n9. Pour the contents of the pan in a colander and drain the water very well.\nCooking milk+butter mixture\n10. In the same pan in which the potatoes were cooked, add \u00bd cup + 2 tablespoons milk.\n12. Add 2 tablespoons butter.\n13. Add \u00bd teaspoon finely chopped or minced garlic. Please note that you can add garlic even while boiling potatoes which at times I even do.\n14. On a low to medium-low flame begin to heat the pan. Stir occasionally. The butter will begin to melt initially.\n15. Let the milk+butter+garlic mixture become hot or come to a boil.\n16. Now switch off the flame and add the potatoes in the pan.\nMashing potatoes\n17. Remove the pan from the stovetop and place it on your kitchen countertop. Begin to mash the potatoes with a potato masher or vegetable masher.\n18. Mash till you get a smooth, fluffy and light consistency. Do not mash too much as this will break down the starches more and make for a gummy texture. Some handwork or some hand exercise is good. You can always add more butter and some warm milk to get the desired consistency \u2013 like a little more pouring consistency in the mashed potatoes.\nMaking mashed potatoes\n19. Sprinkle some freshly crushed black pepper and a bit of salt. Go easy on the salt as some saltiness will be there in the potatoes \u2013 remember we added salt while cooking potatoes. You can always add more salt later after doing a taste test.\n20. Add 2 to 3 teaspoons of fresh mixed herbs or \u00bd to 1 teaspoon of dried mixed herbs. I have used a mix of fresh rosemary and parsley here.\n21. Fold the herbs, pepper and salt. Do check the taste and add more pepper, salt or butter if required. Mashed potatoes with a fluffy texture will not fall down as you can see in the photo below. You can even use this recipe of mashed potatoes for making dishes where mashed potatoes are required like shepherd\u2019s pie, pot pies, potato patties etc.\n22. With a spatula place the mashed potatoes in your serving bowl while still hot or warm. Garnish with some chopped parsley or chives. You can add some cubes of butter also as a garnish. Leftover mashed potatoes can be refrigerated or freezed and warmed in the oven just before serving.\nFew more tasty recipes for you!\nOkra Fry\nPotato fry\nStuffed Bell Pepper\nBaked Cauliflower\nSTEP BY STEP PHOTOS ABOVE Many of my recipes have detailed step by step photos and useful tips to help you make it easily and perfectly.\nPIN\nPRINT\nMashed Potatoes\n4.67 from 3 votes\nMashed potatoes recipe that yields fluffy and light texture.

But when they get cooled completely, the crispness is not there and they taste a bit more soft and better. These cheese biscuits stay good in a cold climate at room temperature for about 2 to 3 days. Otherwise keep in the fridge. Makes about 28 to 30 small cheese biscuits.\nCategories Cookies , Satvik - No Onion NO Garlic\nPost navigation\nTrending Recipes\nchivda recipe\nTomato Puree (Homemade & Without Preservatives)\n20 easy and simple eggless cakes recipes\n65 Whole Wheat recipes | Tasty recipes with whole wheat flour (Chapati Atta)\nBest Punjabi Samosa Recipe\nwheat cake | eggless wheat flour cake\nbest gulab jamun \u2013 2 ways\nmomos recipe | dim sum | veg momos\n21 ripe banana recipes | easy banana dessert recipes\nWhole Wheat Banana Cake (Eggless and Vegan)\n20 popular indian dinner recipes | lunch recipes\nEggless Chocolate Cake (Whole Wheat)\noats recipes | 14 oatmeal recipes | easy oats recipes for breakfast or snack\nEasy Pani Puri\npuri recipe for golgappa or pani puri or puchka\ncooker cake | sponge cake in pressure cooker\nrava recipes | 35 sooji recipes | sweets and snacks made with semolina\nhow to make cake without oven | cake recipes without oven\n35 Best Indian Rice Recipes\n30 Popular Indian Breakfast Recipes for Foodies\nyogurt recipes | curd recipes | 30 indian recipes with yogurt or curd\nSoft Whole Wheat Bread | 100% Wholemeal Bread from Scratch (Eggless)\n50 tasty besan recipes (gram flour or chickpea flour recipes)\nPaneer Butter Masala (Restaurant Style)\nEasy No Yeast Pizza Dough (Vegan)\n91 delicious paneer recipes\nBhatura Recipe (Bhature without yeast)\nGet My Secrets to Great Indian Food\nSign up for my FREE Beginners Guide to Delicious Indian Cooking\nDassana Amit\nnamaste and welcome to vegrecipesofindia.com which i started in feb 2009 and is a pure vegetarian blog. i have been passionate about cooking from childhood and began to cook from the age of 10. later having enrolled in a home science degree greatly enhanced my cooking & baking skills and took it to a different level which i now share as foolproof recipes. i was formally trained both in mainstream indian as well as international cuisines.\nAbout Dassana Amit\nComments are closed.\n43 comments/reviews\nSupriya Girish\nDec 02, 2016\nHi Dasanna.. I have started following you recipes since recently and each of the ones I have tried hav come out very well. Thanks to you, my family now considers me a pro at cooking.. \ud83d\ude42\nI had one doubt with this recipe though. is there anything I can do to ensure these biscuits would retain their crispiness if kept for a few days. would frying them help?\ndassana amit\nDec 02, 2016\nthanks supriya and glad to know that your family considers you a pro in cooking. my concern is that deep frying may make the cheese melt and it may stick in the kadai or pan. baking will give a crisp texture. an alternative would be to pan fry or shallow fry, like how we fry tikkis or cutlets. but here also as soon as the base is golden and crisp, the biscuits need to be flipped. with shallow frying also, the biscuits will be crisp till hot. once they cool down, the crispness will not be there. for deep frying, you can check a few pieces to see how they turn out. also you can cut them like shankarpali (diamond cuts) and not round. i guess they will puff up while frying. but my only concern while deep frying is melting cheese. the biscuits should not burst and make a mess in the kadai.\nShubha\nNov 28, 2016\nDear dassana can I use paneer instead of cheddar cheese\u2026.actually ways the difference between paneer n different variety of cheese\ndassana amit\nNov 28, 2016\nshubha, paneer cannot be added in this recipe. cheese is different from paneer. paneer is fresh cheese made by coagulating milk with an acidic ingredient and just involves a few basic steps \u2013 coagulating milk, draining the whey and then setting the paneer. whereas cheese is made with addition of a bacteria culture with the addition of rennet for some types of cheese. depending on the type of the cheese, the coagulating mixture is drained, cooked, pressed and then ripened or cured. or you can say that paneer is fresh cheese, whereas the other varieties of cheese are not fresh cheese.\nShubha\nNov 29, 2016\nOk Dassana\u2026. Thank you\nJerusalem\nApr 29, 2016\nHope this doesn\u2019t taste kaccha in the middle.. Can I bake this?

It is one of the popular and tasty Indian ice cream varieties.\nMaking homemade butterscotch ice cream is easy and not difficult. Praline is made and added to ice cream. Addition of praline gives that crispy bite when eating butterscotch ice cream. If you do not want to make praline, then you can even add store brought butterscotch chips in the ice cream.\nGet My Secrets to Great Indian Food\nSign up for my FREE Beginners Guide to Delicious Indian Cooking\nIn this butterscotch ice cream, I have shared both the recipes of making praline as well as the ice cream . for a more detailed post on the praline, you can check here\u00a0????\u00a0 Praline recipe .\nGenerally, the readymade store brought butterscotch ice cream has a yellow color. I have not added any color in the ice cream. For a yellow color, you can add a bit of turmeric or saffron. Addition of saffron will infuse some of the saffron\u2019s aromatic fragrance in the ice cream.\nMaking both the praline and butterscotch ice cream is very easy . the recipe is similar to the Ice cream recipe i had shared earlier.\nHow to make butterscotch ice cream\nA) making praline: 1. Take 10 to 12 cashews in a mortar-pestle. You can add any nuts of your choice like almonds, walnuts, pecans or roasted peanuts.\n2. With the pestle, crush the cashews to a coarse mixture. Keep aside. You can even chop the nuts.\u00a0you can even chop the nuts or crush them in a food chopper or mixer-grinder.\n3. In a pan add 2 tablespoons butter. Keep the flame to a low.\n4. Add 4 tablespoons sugar when the butter begins to melt.\n5. Mix the sugar with the butter.\n6. On a low flame cook this butter and sugar mixture. Stir at intervals, But do not stir non-stop .\n7. The mixture will begin to change color. Continue to stir at intervals when the sugar starts changing color.\n8. A point will come when the color will become brown and all the sugar will melt.\n9. Check a few drops of the mixture in a bowl of water. It will harden and solidify. When you snap it, it will break easily. This is the hard ball consistency of the sugar.\n10. At this point, switch off the flame when you see all the sugar has melted and caramelized with a brown colored molten liquid.\n11. Then immediately add the crushed cashews.\n12. Mix quickly.\n13. Pour this praline mixture on a plate lined with parchment paper or butter paper. You can also use a plate on which some butter or oil (neutral tasting) has been spread.\n14. Let the praline harden and cool at room temperature.\n15.\u00a0then break praline in small pieces.\n16. Place the praline pieces in a mortar-pestle.\u00a0you can also use a mixer-grinder to crush praline.\n17. With the pestle, crush to a coarse mixture. Keep aside. Do not make a fine powder.\nMaking butterscotch ice cream\n18. In a large bowl or a stand mixer bowl, take 2.75 to 3 cups of chilled whipping cream (30% to 50% fat). Add 1 teaspoon vanilla extract or butterscotch essence.\n19. Begin to whip the cream at full speed, with an electric beater or with the whipping attachment of the stand mixer. Timing will vary depending on the fat content in the cream. Both for amul fresh cream and amul whipping cream, it takes about 8 to 10 minutes. Also be careful while whipping and do not whip too much, as then the cream can get churned into butter.\n20. Whip till stiff peaks are formed. You can also whip till soft peaks. If using 25% fat cream, then you can whip till soft peaks.\n21. Now add 400 grams of chilled sweetened condensed milk (about 1.6 cups).\n22. Also add the crushed praline. Reserve 1 tablespoon of the praline mixture as a garnish.\n23. Fold gently but very well. Also, remember not to overfold as then the butterscotch ice cream mixture can fall flat.\n24. Remove the butterscotch ice cream mixture in a container or box and then cover it tightly. Freeze till the ice cream is set.\n25. Before serving, keep the butterscotch ice cream box or bowl for some minutes at room temperature. Then using a scoop, remove the ice cream. Serve butterscotch ice cream . you can sprinkle the reserved praline mixture on top while serving. You can also pour butterscotch sauce. Alternatively, chocolate chips or grated chocolate or candied fruits or even tutti frutti can be sprinkled from top if you want.\nSome more Ice cream recipes that you can make during summers are:\nVanilla ice cream\nChocolate ice cream\nPistachio ice cream\nTutti frutti ice cream\nChoco chip ice cream\nSTEP BY STEP PHOTOS ABOVE Many of my recipes have detailed step by step photos and useful tips to help you make it easily and perfectly.\nPIN\nPRINT\nButterscotch Ice Cream\n5 from 5 votes\nButterscotch ice cream is one of the popular and tasty Indian ice cream varieties.

Both the recipes are tried and tested and taste good.\nYou can grill or toast these paneer sandwiches. you will need green chutney or sandwich chutney to prepare these sandwiches. I have mentioned the sandwich chutney recipe below. If you do not have this chutney, then you can even skip it.\nSandwich chutney recipe for paneer sandwich\nMethod: rinse 1 cup tightly packed coriander leaves and 2 green chillies very well in water. Drain all the water and add the rinsed leaves in a small grinder jar. Add \u00bd tsp chaat masala powder and salt as required. Grind the chutney ingredients till smooth. No need to add water while grinding as there is enough moisture after rinsing the coriander leaves which helps them to grind to a smooth chutney. If you are unable to grind, then add 1 or 2 teaspoons of water. Remove sandwich chutney and keep aside. A few drops of lemon juice can also be added.\nI have divided the entire post into following parts:\nMaking paneer sandwich Indian style \u2013 recipe 1\nMaking vegetable paneer sandwich \u2013 recipe 2\nUse this link to Jump to recipe\nThis first recipe\nShared is an\nIndian style paneer sandwich which includes green chutney, spices and herbs. You can alter the amount of spices and herbs as per your taste buds.\nHow to make paneer sandwich (Indian style) \u2013 recipe 1\n1. Crumble 200 grams paneer in a bowl or pan. Do not crumble finely. Some small chunks of paneer is fine. You can even chop paneer in small cubes instead of crumbling.\n2. Add the following spice powders \u2013 1 pinch of turmeric powder, \u00bc teaspoon cumin powder, \u00bd teaspoon Kashmiri red chilli powder, \u00bd teaspoon coriander powder (ground coriander), \u00bd teaspoon garam masala powder, \u00bd teaspoon dry mango powder (amchur powder).\n3. Add 2 tablespoon fresh curd (yogurt). Also season with salt as per taste.\n4. Mix very well.\n5. Take the bread slices and spread some butter on them. I have used whole wheat bread. You can use any bread of your choice like brown bread, white bread, multigrain bread or whole wheat sandwich bread.\n6. Spread sandwich chutney on the slices. Recipe of sandwich chutney is mentioned in recipe card below. Addition of sandwich chutney is optional and you can skip it also. Or you can use any green chutney you have like mint chutney or coriander chutney or mint coriander chutney.\n7. Now place some thin onion slices and sliced bell pepper. I have used red bell pepper (red capsicum or shimla mirch), you can use green or yellow bell pepper or skip them altogether.\n8. Sprinkle some chaat masala on top.\n9. Add the paneer stuffing.\n10. Cover with the remaining bread slices on which both butter and sandwich chutney has already been spread.\n11. Place the paneer sandwiches in a preheated sandwich maker.\n12. Grill till crisp and golden.\nRemove and\u00a0 Serve grilled paneer\u00a0sandwich hot or warm with any dip or sauce of your choice. You can serve it with tomato ketchup or pudina chutney or coriander chutney or any chutney or dip of your choice.\nTips for making paneer sandwich\nI have used whole wheat bread to make these sandwiches. You can use any bread of your choice like brown bread, white bread, multigrain bread or whole wheat sandwich bread.\nThese sandwiches taste best with fresh paneer. If you use frozen paneer, then the stuffing feels a bit dry. If you buy paneer from a halwai or from a store, then make sure the paneer is moist and fresh. Or else you can make paneer at home.\nTo make a vegan version of paneer sandwich, replace paneer with tofu and butter with olive oil. Also don\u2019t forget to use vegan curd.\nGreen chutney can be skipped. You can be creative by adding vegan or vegetarian mayonnaise or hung curd or cream cheese as a spread.\nVegetable paneer sandwich \u2013 recipe 2\nThis veg\u00a0paneer sandwich which I make sometimes, \u00a0 Is a variation of the Bombay veg sandwich. Along with the paneer, vegetables & the green chutney, the sandwich becomes a healthy one.\nIf you don\u2019t have the veggies , then you can still make the sandwich with the paneer stuffing. In this recipe I made a fusion of Italian and Indian flavors. The paneer has Italian-Indian herbs in it, whilst the veggies is spiced with Indian spices. For the paneer stuffing, I have used basil leaves, celery and coriander. You can make good fusion sandwiches by combining different flavors. To make a vegan version of paneer sandwich, replace paneer with tofu and butter with olive oil.\nHere I have used homemade whole wheat bread. You can use any bread like\u00a0brown bread\u00a0or white bread to make this sandwich.\nI served the \u00a0 Veg \u00a0 Paneer sandwich with coriander chutney and tomato sauce. However, the sandwich can also be served with basil pesto.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor sandwiches 8 to 10 slices of whole wheat bread or brown bread or white bread 1 medium size tomato 1 beetroot \u2013 boiled and peeled 1 potato \u2013 boiled and peeled 1 medium size onion \u2013 peeled Chaat masala as required Cumin powder as required Butter or olive oil as required\nFor paneer stuffing 200 grams paneer (cottage cheese) 4 to 5 Italian basil leaves 1 teaspoon chopped celery 1 tablespoon chopped coriander leaves (cilantro leaves) \u00bd teaspoon dry oregano \u00bc teaspoon black pepper powder \u00bc teaspoon red chili powder or red chili flakes 1 green chili \u2013 chopped Rock salt or black salt as required\nHow to make veg paneer sandwich \u2013 recipe 2\n1. Crumble the paneer with your hands or grate it. Add the chopped basil, celery, coriander leaves, green chillies along with black pepper, red chilli powder and salt. Mix well.\n2. Spread or brush some butter or olive oil on the bread. Add a tbsp or more of the paneer mixture on the bread. Sprinkle some chaat masala and cumin powder. Place two or three slices each of boiled potato, onion, boiled beetroot and tomato. Sprinkle some salt, chaat masala and cumin powder again.\n3. Place the second buttered or oiled bread on top and either grill or toast the sandwich. Here I have used my old sandwich hand toaster which works on stovetop.\n4. Once the sandwiches are browned, then remove and spread some butter if required on the sandwiches.\u00a0 Serve veg paneer sandwich\u00a0hot with mint chutney and tomato sauce.\nMore\nSandwich recipes\nClub sandwich\nCheese sandwich\nMayonnaise sandwich\nGrilled sandwich\nThis paneer sandwich recipe is from the archives and was originally published on 29 jan 2017.

I was wondering because I have always applied butter on the outer side also thinking that this will give the golden look to the sandwich..\ndassana amit\nAug 03, 2017\nruchi, i have not applied butter outside. i guess i spread too much butter on the inside of the bread. so when grilling the butter has come out on the top side through the bread and made it crisp. but many times i do not apply butter for most sandwiches on outside and they turn out crisp.\nNanditha\nMar 22, 2017\nHi ,\nThank you for all your efforts.

A popular snack in the South Indian region is thattai and is made mostly during the festivals of krishna jayanthi and Diwali. In south India the sweet and bakery stores sell thattai all around the year.\nThattai \u2013 what is it?\nThattai is a deep-fried crisp cracker made with rice flour, lentil flours, spices and herbs. a basic recipe of thattai has a dough made with mixing rice flour, roasted and ground urad dal flour, soaked chana dal, grated or sliced fresh coconut (optional), curry leaves, asafoetida (hing), either ground green chillies or red chilli powder, salt and butter or ghee.\nGet My Secrets to Great Indian Food\nSign up for my FREE Beginners Guide to Delicious Indian Cooking\nWhile in Tamil Nadu, these crispy crackers are called as Thattai . in Karnataka these are known as Nippattu and in Andhra Pradesh known as Chekkalu . there are some variations in the method of preparation in these regions, but the basic ingredients remain the same. Thattai is also known as Thattai murukku and Thattu vadai .\nOne of our readers had shared thattai recipe some years back. The recipe was lying in my email and I never got to making thattai. So one fine day I thought of trying the recipe and made it. The thattai was crispy, crunchy and so good. It was definitely better than the store brought ones as that typical smell of overused oil was not there. It was not too spicy for us as store brought ones are usually too spicy.\nAfter making the thattai, I felt the thattai recipe definitely needs to be shared on the blog. I have made a few changes to the recipe which have made it only better. These thattai stay crisp. So you do not need to worry about them getting soft after some days. The recipe makes for 25 thattai and can be easily scaled up by increasing the proportion of ingredients. So let us see the detailed method of making thattai with step by step pictures.\nHow to make thattai recipe\nPreparation\n1. Firstly rinse and then soak 1 tablespoon chana dal in hot water for 30 minutes.\n2. Heat a heavy kadai or pan. Keep the flame to low or medium-low. Add 1 tablespoon urad dal (husked and whole or split black gram).\n3. Lightly roast urad dal for 1 to 2 minutes. You don\u2019t need to brown the dal. Remove and keep aside. Instead of using urad dal, you can also use urad dal flour. Just add 1 tablespoon urad dal flour in the dough mixture.\n4. In the same kadai or pan, add 1 cup rice flour (160 grams). I have here used packaged rice flour but homemade rice flour can also be used.\n5. On a low to medium-low flame stirring often, roast the rice flour.\n6. Roast rice flour till it becomes warm to touch.\n7. Remove and keep aside in a mixing bowl.\n8. In a small grinder, take the roasted urad dal. Also add 1 tablespoon roasted chana dal. You can even skip roasted chana dal. Roasted chana dal helps in making the thattai light and crispy.\n9. Grind to a fine powder.\nMaking thattai dough\n10. To the bowl containing the rice flour add the ground lentil flours.\n11. Add 1 tablespoon chopped curry leaves or 10 to 12 curry leaves (chopped), \u00bc teaspoon asafoetida powder (hing), \u00bd teaspoon red chilli powder or add as required, 1 teaspoon white sesame seeds, \u00bd teaspoon salt or add as per taste. You can even add 2 tablespoons fresh grated coconut or thinly sliced coconut (optional).\n12. Mix the salt, spices and herbs with the flours.\n13. Now sprinkle 2 tablespoons water and add 1 tablespoon butter in the flour mixture. You can add 1 tablespoon ghee instead of butter. You can use both salted or unsalted butter.\n14. With your fingertips mix the butter with the flour. Mix very well.\n15. Add 3 tablespoons water.\n16. Gently mix and start bringing the mixture together.\n17. Drain all the water and then add the soaked chana dal.\n18. Mix and then knead to a smooth semi-soft dough or a slightly stiff dough. Add 3 to 4 tablespoons water or as required while kneading the dough. I used about a total of 9.5 tablespoons water. Addition of water will depend on the texture and quality of rice flour . so add in parts. Do not make a soft dough as then it becomes difficult to shape and lift the thattai rounds. Do not make the dough too hard as then thattai will not be crisp. It will have a hard and dense texture. Also, check the taste of dough and add more salt if required. Cover and keep aside. Dough should not be sticky or pasty.\nTip 1: if dough becomes sticky, then add some rice flour and knead.\nTip 2: if the dough is dry and hard, sprinkle some water. Mix and knead.\nShaping thattai\n19. Take a butter paper or parchment paper or a ziplock bag or a clean cotton napkin. Grease the butter paper or parchment paper with some oil. Also keep oil for deep frying in a kadai or pan. Keep the flame to medium or medium-high. If using a cotton cloth or napkin, then no need to grease it.\n20. Make small balls from the dough.\n21. Place a dough ball on the greased parchment paper.\n22. Press and flatten thattai with your fingertips to a thin round. Spread some oil on your fingers while flattening them. Do not make them too thin and flat as then you cannot lift them.\n23. Make 5 to 6 thattai on the parchment paper. Make thattai as you go on frying them. Thus make one batch and add in the oil. When this first batch is getting fried, make the second batch. But do keep an eye on the batch that is getting fried.\n24. Check the temperature of oil by adding a tiny piece of the thattai dough. If it comes up swiftly on top, the oil is hot enough.\n25. Lift the thattai gently from the paper. While lifting the thattai, lift the paper slightly too as this helps too easily pull the thattai from the paper.\nFrying thattai\n26. Gently place thattai rounds in the hot oil.\n27. Begin to fry. Keep flame to medium or medium-high while frying.\n28. When one side is crisp, then flip over each thattai.\n29. Fry the second side till crisp. You can flip a couple of times for that even golden color and crispness.\n30. Fry thattai till crispy and crunchy. When the oils stops bubbling and sizzling, this means the thattai is fried and done. Remove with a slotted spoon or spider spoon.\n31. Place fried thattai on kitchen paper towels.\n32. As soon as the thattai cools at room temperature, place them in a steel box or jar. Make all thattai this way.\n33. Serve thattai to the deities if making for festivals. If making as an evening snack, then serve with masala chai or filter coffee.\nTips to make thattai\nAmount of asafoetida (hing) can be reduced if you want.\nCheck the taste of dough and add more salt if required.\nRoasted chana dal can be skipped. Though it helps in making the thattai lighter and crispy.\nHomemade rice flour can be used. Parboiled rice flour can also be used.\nAmount of water to be added will depend on the texture of flour. So add in parts and knead.\nYou need to get a semi-soft dough. Do not make dough soft as then it becomes difficult to shape and lift. Do not make dough too hard as then thattai will not be crisp. It will become hard and dense.\nFry thattai in oil till it stops bubbling. Fry on medium flame. Turn over when one side is crisp. Fry till crisp and crunchy.\nUse parchment or butter paper or a ziplock bag. Spread some oil on the parchment paper. Press thattai dough balls with your fingertips. Do not make very thin as then you cannot lift it up.\nFor a gluten free version of thattai recipe, skip asafoetida.\nTo make a vegan recipe of thattai, add oil instead of butter or ghee. You can use vegan butter too.\nFew more Diwali\u00a0faral recipes\nShankarpali recipe\nNankhatai recipe\nRibbon pakoda\nButter murukku\nPoha chivda recipe .\nSTEP BY STEP PHOTOS ABOVE Many of my recipes have detailed step by step photos and useful tips to help you make it easily and perfectly.\nPIN\nPRINT\nThattai Recipe\n4.84 from 6 votes\nThattai are deep-fried crispy rice crackers served as a snack and made during festivals like krishna jayanthi (gokulashtmi) or Diwali.

Bread sticks are a tasty cheesy snack made popular by the pizza joints in India. Making cheese breadsticks at home is not difficult and with a good quality yeast, you can make bread sticks tasting better than the pizza joints.\nTo make these cheesy breadsticks , I have used 3 types of cheese viz \u2013 cheddar cheese, mozzarella cheese and vegetarian parmesan cheese. But you can also use just one or two types of cheese. Even pizza cheese can be used.

This eggless sour cream cake was one of the best cakes I have made during recent times.\nIt has a soft and moist crumb. The cinnamon flavored streusel stuffing is like an icing on the cake. The crunch and sweetness of the dry fruits in the streusel is in contrast with the softness of the cake and tastes too good.\nGet My Secrets to Great Indian Food\nSign up for my FREE Beginners Guide to Delicious Indian Cooking\nSour cream cake is called as a coffee cake, but do not get misled . there is no coffee added in the cake. This cake is served with coffee and thus called as coffee cake. So basically this cake recipe is of an Eggless sour cream cake .\nI had some sour cream left after making the vegetarian tacos. So was wondering what to do with the sour cream. Checked my books and saw a cake made with sour cream. So the recipe is loosely adapted from the cook book \u201cbakin\u2019 without eggs: delicious egg-free dessert recipes\u201d by rosemarie emro.\nThis cake is egg free and makes use of whole wheat flour. The denseness of whole wheat bakes is not felt in this cake. Even though sour cream is used, but you can easily make this cake with fresh curd or yogurt. Even low fat sour cream or low fat yogurt can be used.\nI have mixed and beaten all the ingredients in a stand mixer. But you can use a handheld electric beater also.\nEggless sour cream cake can be served as a coffee cake. You can even serve as a tea time cake or as a dessert after meals.\nHow to make eggless sour cream cake\nA) preparation and making streusel:\n1. Grease 2 bundt (5.5 inches) pans with butter. You can also use a 7.5 to 8 inches round pan or 1 large bundt pan.\n2. In a bowl take\u00a01 tablespoon unsalted butter.\n3. On a low flame begin to melt butter.\u00a0you just need to melt the butter.\n4. Remove the bowl from the stove burner and keep down.\n5. Add\u00a0\u00bc cup finely chopped nuts. You can use any crunchy nuts. I have added an equal mix of chopped pistachios, cashews and almonds.\n6. Then add\u00a04 tablespoons brown sugar,\u00a01 tablespoon whole wheat flour and\u00a01 teaspoon cinnamon powder.\n7. Mix very well. Keep the streusel filling aside.\nMaking sour cream cake batter\n8. In a mixing bowl or a stand mixer bowl take\u00a0150 grams sugar (\u00be cup sugar) and\u00a057 to 60 grams softened unsalted butter (\u00bc cup unsalted butter). Meanwhile preheat oven at 180 degrees celsius for 20 minutes.\n9. Using the paddle attachment of a stand mixer, beat on medium to high speed till butter becomes fluffy.

I haven\u2019t had coffee cake since I stopped eating eggs, and I was really missing it. Your recipe is delicious and was just what I was missing \ud83d\ude42 ! Very fluffy and moist and just the right amount of sweetness.\nThe way we make it is a little different in the American Midwest (in a square pan with cinnamon streusel topping) so I tweaked that part accordingly and added milk instead of water to the batter.\nThanks again! Love your website!\ndassana amit\nJun 12, 2019\nnamaste tara. thank you for the review and rating on coffee cake. this is also our favorite coffee cake. also thanks for sharing your version and the variation you made. welcome and happy cooking.\nRuchi\nFeb 13, 2019\nHi dassana, The cake pics are lovely. Would like to try this one. I had some queries regarding this recipe.. 1. Whole wheat flour which is added in the streusel, does it also get \u2018cooked\u2019 while baking? (since it remains separate from rest of the cake batter)\n2. Does this cake have mild sweetness? or usual sweetness like normal cakes. I plan to use fresh curd & l want the cake to turn out more on the sweet side (folks at my place prefer the desserts to be sweet) 3. What kind of cinnamon powder do you use? Is it simply cinnamon sticks ground in mixie..\nThank you for sharing all the amazing recipes!\ndassana\nFeb 13, 2019\nthanks ruchi and welcome. your queries answered below.\n1. yes the whole wheat flour in the streusel does get cooked.\n2. the cake is lightly sweet but the streusel does add some extra sweetness when eating. so it kind of balances the sweet taste. but for a sweeter cake you can add 1 cup sugar as you are using fresh curd.\n3. yes it is cinnamon ground in a mixie. cinnamon sticks that we get in india are of two types.\n1. one is cassia cinnamon also known as just cassia, which is not actually cinnamon. most shops or online stores you will get cassia cinnamon which is a cheap substitute of cinnamon. it has a very strong aroma and the sticks are thick and kind of like a tree bark.\n2. true cinnamon or the real cinnamon has thin sticks and in a rolled shape, they look like cigar rolls. the aroma is not very strong and intense. i have used both versions and real cinnamon gives a better flavor and aroma than cassia. also cassia cinnamon is not good for health and toxic. so better to avoid. on google, you can get to see both varieties and also get to know the difference.\nSuhani\nOct 13, 2018\nHi Dassana, Thank you for the amazing recipe. Can\u2019t wait to try it! One question- Is it necessary to use that kind of cake pan? Will it still taste good if I use normal cake pan\u2026 or a bread pan? One comment- When I saw \u201csour cream coffee cake\u201d, i thought there will be coffee in it and I was about to skip this recipe because we don\u2019t eat coffee. I don\u2019t know if that is what this cake is authentically called but if not, I would consider changing the title for those 0.1% of weird users like me \ud83d\ude09\nThank you!\ndassana amit\nOct 13, 2018\nwelcome suhani. you can use normal cake pan too. it will taste the same whether bundt pan is used or normal cake pan is used. this cake is actually and authentically called coffee cake. but it does not have any coffee in it. i have kept the same title as thats what its known by and so it helps the readers to find the recipe who know the name of this cake.\nSuhani Mehta\nOct 15, 2018\nThanks Dassana! Are there any substitutes for brown sugar?\ndassana amit\nOct 16, 2018\nwelcome. you can use regular white sugar or even unrefined cane sugar. even jaggery can be used.\nSuhani Mehta\nOct 17, 2018\nTried honey instead of brown sugar and made it in a bread pan. Came out delicious!! But honey being heavy sunk at the bottom. Need to get brown sugar for next time. Thanks, Dassana, for such an awesome recipe! I love the fact that you focus on healthy recipes\u2026. using wheat flour instead of maida.\ndassana amit\nOct 17, 2018\nthanks for sharing suhani. yes with honey it will sink due to it being viscous and heavy. being a baker, i would not suggest using honey for baking or while cooking. honey on being heated becomes toxic according to ayurveda. even i was not aware of this fact some years back and i would add a bit of honey in tomato based gravies instead of sugar and i have also made brown bread once with honey instead of sugar. but now i do not add honey in baked goods and i always suggest blog readers to avoid heating honey. honey is best had raw plain or with some mixed fruits or cereals.\nsowndarya\nFeb 25, 2018\nmade the cake with fresh curds. it turned out very well. thnx for the recipe \ud83d\ude42\ndassana amit\nFeb 26, 2018\nthanks for letting me know sowndarya. nice to know. happy baking.\ntasty\nFeb 24, 2018\nvery sweet nice done\nDr. Zainab Ahmad\nFeb 23, 2018\nHi Dassana, really love your recipes.

You can add \u00bd to 1 teaspoon red chili powder and \u00bd teaspoon cumin powder instead of dry red chili and cumin seeds.\nGrind to a fine powder. Keep aside. For more spicy ribbon pakoda, you can add 2 to 3 dry red chilies. You can also add green chili paste instead of dry red chili. Ginger paste or garlic paste or onion paste can also be added.\nTake a plate, pan or a large mixing bowl. Place a sieve on top of it. Add \u00bd cup besan and \u00bd cup heaped rice flour.\nThen add the ground roasted chana dal,\u00a01 teaspoon salt and \u215b\u00a0teaspoon hing.\u00a0\nSift the whole mixture.\nThen add 1 teaspoon white sesame seeds. Keep aside.\u00a0\nIn a small pan or a bowl heat 2 tablespoons butter or oil. I have used salted butter, but you can even use unsalted butter.\nHeat till all the butter melts. Now add the hot melted butter in the flour mixture.\nWith a spoon or spatula mix the butter with the flour. Mix very well. Check the taste and if required you can add some more salt.\nNow add \u2153\u00a0cup water in parts and\u00a0begin to knead the flour mixture.\nKnead to a smooth and non-sticky dough. Cover and keep aside. If the dough looks dry then you can add some more water. If it becomes sticky then add some more besan.\u00a0\nfrying ribbon pakoda\nUse the nozzle shown in the below picture for preparing ribbon pakoda. This one has serrated edges. You can even use the plain one without the serrated edges. Also heat a kadai and add oil as required for deep frying ribbon pakodas.\nApply some water or oil in the chakli/murukku maker. Then take a portion of the murukku dough and place it inside the murukku maker. Cover with the top part and keep aside.\nLet the oil in the kadai become medium hot. Check the oil temperature by adding a small piece of the dough. If the dough comes up gradually and steadily on top, the oil is hot enough to fry. If it comes up too quickly, then oil is too hot. If it settles down at bottom of kadai or comes up very slowly, the oil is not hot enough.\nWhen the oil is hot enough, directly press holding the murukku maker on top of the oil and let the ribbon murukku directly fall in the oil.\nWhile pressing rotate in a concentric circle from the center to outwards similar to making a chakli. Do not over crowd the kadai with ribbon pakoda. Add as much as needed without overcrowding the kadai.\nAfter adding the murukku, do not touch them immediately with the slotted spoon as they break. Let them get fried first. They need to become crisp first and then you can turn them over with the slotted spoon.\nFry till they have become light golden.\nTurn over the ribbon pakoda gently with a slotted spoon, so that they get fried evenly.\nNow fry this side also till it becomes light golden.\nTurn over a couple of times for even frying. Fry till they are crisp and golden.\nWhen the oil stops sizzling it means the pakoda are fried. Then remove them with a slotted spoon or a strainer spoon. Do not over brown or else the pakora becomes slightly dense. Also do not fry at low heat or low flame or else the pakora absorbs too much oil.\nPlace them on kitchen paper towels. Fry the remaining pakoda in the same way.\nWhen they are cooled, then place them in an air-tight container or box.\nServe ribbon pakoda as a diwali snack or a tea time snack.\nNotes\nYou can also halve or double the recipe.\nThis recipe roughly serves 250 grams of ribbon pakoda.\nNote that the approx nutrition data is for 1 serving of ribbon pakoda.\u00a0\nNutrition Info (approximate values)\nNutrition Facts\nRibbon Pakoda\nAmount Per Serving\nCalories 340\nCalories from Fat 162\n% Daily Value*\nFat 18g 28%\nSaturated Fat 5g 31%\nPolyunsaturated Fat 1g\nMonounsaturated Fat 1g\nCholesterol 15mg 5%\nSodium 640mg 28%\nPotassium 112mg 3%\nCarbohydrates 37g 12%\nFiber 7g 29%\nSugar 2g 2%\nProtein 7g 14%\nVitamin A 208IU 4%\nVitamin B1 (Thiamine) 1mg 67%\nVitamin B3 (Niacin) 1mg 5%\nVitamin B6 1mg 50%\nVitamin C 1mg 1%\nVitamin D 1\u00b5g 7%\nVitamin E 4mg 27%\nVitamin K 1\u00b5g 1%\nCalcium 45mg 5%\nIron 4mg 22%\nMagnesium 9mg 2%\nPhosphorus 23mg 2%\nZinc 1mg 7%\n* Percent Daily Values are based on a 2000 calorie diet.\nGOOD KARMA all our content & photos are copyright protected. a lot of time and effort is spent in researching, developing, testing and photographing recipes. please do not copy. as a blogger, if you you want to adapt this recipe or make a youtube video, then please write the recipe in your own words and give a clickable link back to the recipe on this url.\nTRIED THIS RECIPE ? i would love to hear from you. if you have made this recipe then rate the recipe or leave a comment below. if you like this recipe then do share the recipe link on facebook, twitter & pinterest. for instagram mention @vegrecipesofindia or tag #vegrecipesofindia\nHow to make ribbon pakoda recipe\n1.

I have used salted butter, but you can even use unsalted butter.\n10. Heat till all the butter melts. Instead of butter you can also use oil.\n11. Now add the hot melted butter in the flour mixture.\n12. With a spoon or spatula mix the butter with the flour. Mix very well. Check the taste and if required you can add some more salt.\n13. Now add\u00a0\u2153\u00a0cup water in parts.\n14. Begin to knead the flour.\n15. Knead to a smooth non-sticky dough adding water as required. Cover and keep aside. If the dough becomes sticky, then you can add some more besan. If the dough looks dry, then add some more water.\nFrying\u00a0ribbon pakoda\n16. Use the disc shown in the below picture for preparing ribbon pakoda. This one has serrated edges. You can even use the plain one without the serrated edges. Also\u00a0heat a kadai and add oil as required for deep frying ribbon pakodas.\n17. Apply some water or oil in the chakli/murukku maker. Then\u00a0take a portion of the murukku dough and place it inside the murukku maker. Cover with the top part and keep aside.\n18. Let the oil in the kadai become medium hot. Check the oil temperature by adding a small piece of the dough. If the dough comes up gradually and steadily on top, the oil is hot enough to fry. If it comes up too quickly, then oil is too hot. If it settles down at bottom of kadai or comes up very slowly, the oil is not hot enough.\n19. When the oil is hot enough, directly press\u00a0holding the murukku maker on top of the oil and let the ribbon murukku directly fall in the oil.\n20. While pressing rotate in a concentric circle from the center to outwards similar to making a Chakli . do not over crowd the kadai with ribbon pakoda. Add as much as needed without overcrowding the kadai.\n21. After adding the murukku, do not touch them immediately with the slotted spoon as they break. Let them get fried first. They need to become crisp first and then you can turn them over with the slotted spoon.\n22. Fry till the murukku has become light golden.\n23. Turn over the ribbon pakoda gently with a slotted spoon.\n24. Now fry this side also till it becomes light golden.\n25. Turn over a couple of times for even frying.\u00a0fry till the ribbon pakoda are crisp and golden.\n26. When the oil stops sizzling it means the ribbon pakoda are fried. Then remove ribbon pakoda with a slotted spoon or a strainer spoon. Do not over brown or else the pakora becomes slightly dense. Also do not fry at low heat or low flame or else the pakora absorbs too much oil.\n27. Place them on kitchen paper towels. Fry the remaining pakoda in the same way.\n28. When the ribbon pakoda are cooled, then place them in an air tight container or box.\n29. Serve ribbon pakoda as a Diwali snack or a tea time snack.\nCategories Evening Snacks , Satvik - No Onion NO Garlic , Snacks Recipes , South Indian Food , Tamil Nadu Recipes\nPost navigation\nTrending Recipes\nSoft Whole Wheat Bread | 100% Wholemeal Bread from Scratch (Eggless)\n21 ripe banana recipes | easy banana dessert recipes\ncooker cake | sponge cake in pressure cooker\nTomato Puree (Homemade & Without Preservatives)\n20 easy and simple eggless cakes recipes\nBest Punjabi Samosa Recipe\n30 Popular Indian Breakfast Recipes for Foodies\nBhatura Recipe (Bhature without yeast)\noats recipes | 14 oatmeal recipes | easy oats recipes for breakfast or snack\nbest gulab jamun \u2013 2 ways\npuri recipe for golgappa or pani puri or puchka\nPaneer Butter Masala (Restaurant Style)\n65 Whole Wheat recipes | Tasty recipes with whole wheat flour (Chapati Atta)\nWhole Wheat Banana Cake (Eggless and Vegan)\n91 delicious paneer recipes\nhow to make cake without oven | cake recipes without oven\nEggless Chocolate Cake (Whole Wheat)\nEasy No Yeast Pizza Dough (Vegan)\n20 popular indian dinner recipes | lunch recipes\n35 Best Indian Rice Recipes\nyogurt recipes | curd recipes | 30 indian recipes with yogurt or curd\nmomos recipe | dim sum | veg momos\nrava recipes | 35 sooji recipes | sweets and snacks made with semolina\n50 tasty besan recipes (gram flour or chickpea flour recipes)\nchivda recipe\nEasy Pani Puri\nwheat cake | eggless wheat flour cake\nGet My Secrets to Great Indian Food\nSign up for my FREE Beginners Guide to Delicious Indian Cooking\nDassana Amit\nnamaste and welcome to vegrecipesofindia.com which i started in feb 2009 and is a pure vegetarian blog. i have been passionate about cooking from childhood and began to cook from the age of 10. later having enrolled in a home science degree greatly enhanced my cooking & baking skills and took it to a different level which i now share as foolproof recipes. i was formally trained both in mainstream indian as well as international cuisines.\nAbout Dassana Amit\nComments are closed.\n10 comments/reviews\nIllakkiya\nNov 02, 2018\nHi my pakkoda turns out dark brown color with extra crisp no taste at all..

It took me less than 10 minutes to assemble and pack them. The combo of plain bread and amul butter tasted so good. And also black pepper. Since I had to pack them for 8 hours duration, I didn\u2019t add tomato as I thought they would get sullen. Will cucumber stay good for that long? Since I skipped veggies, we had the sandwiches with ketchup but they still tasted very nice. Thank you.\ndassana amit\nSep 19, 2017\nthank you ruchi. in 8 hours cucumber and tomato will soften and taste different too. whenever we travel, i do make tomato-cucumber sandwiches, but we have them in about 4 hours. as you mentioned bread, butter with some black pepper also tastes good. sometimes i just make bread, butter with some black pepper and chaat masala and this also tastes good.\nmenu\nHome\nRecipes Index\nBy Ingredients\nBhindi (Okra)\nBrinjal (Eggplant)\nCabbage\nCapsicum\nCauliflower\nChickpeas\nFenugreek\nMushroom\nPaneer Recipes\nGreen Peas\nSpinach\nPotato\nBy Indian Cuisine\nAndhra Recipes\nBengali Recipes\nGoan Recipes\nGujarati Recipes\nHyderabadi Recipes\nKarnataka Recipes\nKashmiri Recipes\nKerala Recipes\nKonkan Recipes\nMaharashtrian Recipes\nNorth Indian Food\nPunjabi Recipes\nSouth Indian Food\nUttar Pradesh Cuisine\nTamil Nadu Recipes\nBreakfast\nEasy Breakfast\nIdli\nDosa Varieties\nParatha Recipes\nSnacks\nStarters & Snacks\nStreet Food\nEvening Snacks\nBread Snacks\nPakora Recipes\nSandwich Recipes\nSweets & Desserts\nBurfi (Fudge)\nCookies\nDesserts\nEggless Cakes\nIce Cream\nHalwa Recipes\nKheer and Payasam\nLadoo Recipes\nSweets\nBeverages\nBeverages\nJuices\nMilkshakes\nSmoothie\nTea & Coffee\nRice\nIndian Rice Recipes\nPulao Recipes\nBiryani Varieties\nMain Course\nVegetables\nCurry\nDal (Lentils) & Legumes\nSambar\nPasta Recipes\nPizza Recipes\nIndian Breads\nIndian Chinese\nBread Recipes\nInstant Pot\nAccompaniments\nChutney Recipes\nPickles\nRaita Recipes\nSalad Recipes\nRasam Varieties\nSoup Recipes\nSpecial Diet\nVegan Recipes\nGluten Free Recipes\nLow Fat Recipes\nSatvik \u2013 No Onion NO Garlic\nNavratri & Fasting Recipes\nDIY\nSpice Mix\nCondiment\nDIY\nAbout\nfree email series\nGet My Secrets to Great Indian Food\nSign up for my FREE Beginners Guide to Delicious Indian Cooking\nFIND A RECIPE\nSearch for:\nNamaste.

So I created My own recipes to get a cake which is light, fluffy and soft like a sponge cake made from eggs. I have had sponge cake made with eggs many times as a kid and in fact, even made them many times during my teens. So when developing eggless sponge cake recipes, the texture never came to the ones made with eggs. A few recipes were disasters.\nGet My Secrets to Great Indian Food\nSign up for my FREE Beginners Guide to Delicious Indian Cooking\nAgain I tried to develop an eggless sponge cake recipe . before preparing the recipe, I was thinking whether to add whole wheat flour or all purpose flour. Finally I decided to add whole wheat flour. The recipe was a success. It did not have a sponge cake like texture, but too good for an eggless whole wheat cake.\nI decided to add this recipe as why not share a good recipe with good results with all of you. If I can prepare it, so can you. And it is indeed satisfying and fulfilling to bake cakes and breads for your family. More so when they have an additional health element in them.\nThe recipe makes for a 6\u00d76 inches whole wheat cake and its a small cake . you can serve this wheat cake plain as a tea time snack or even as a dessert. You can also use this cake as base in trifle pudding and even frost it with any icing.\nI have also used this recipe and made few changes to make\u00a0 Sponge cake recipe in cooker and also this Carrot cake .\nPlease do note that I have used organic chakki ground whole wheat flour in the recipe. Its the same flour which I use for making chapatis.\nHow to make wheat cake\n1. Grease a 6\u00d76 inches square pan with softened butter. You can also use 5 to 6 inches round pan.\n2. In a seive, add\u00a01 cup whole wheat flour (120 grams) and \u00bd teaspoon baking powder. Keep the sieve on top of a mixing bowl or pan.\n3. Sift both the dry ingredients. Also preheat oven at 180 degrees celsius/356 degrees fahrenheit for 20 minutes.\n4. Now add \u00bd cup sweetened condensed milk (125 ml or 125 grams).\n5. Add\u00a01 teaspoon vanilla extract or \u00bd teaspoon vanilla essence\n6. Do not mix. Just keep aside.\n7. In another pan, take\u00a080 grams butter and \u00bd cup water.\n8. Add\u00a04 tablespoons sugar.\n9. Keep the pan on stove top and on a low\u00a0flame heat this mixture.\n10. The butter will melt initially. Do stir occasionally.\n11. Bring this mixture to a boil.\n12. Once the mixture comes to a boil, then remove the pan and pour the entire boiling hot mixture into the flour mixture.\n13.\u00a0with a wired whisk, begin to mix lightly.\n14.\u00a0mix with light pressure, so that over mixing does not happen. While mixing you will come to know if the batter is going to be thick or too thick.\u00a0\u00a0the batter in this recipe is of medium consistency \u2013 neither thick nor thin. Depending on the quality of flour, you may need to add less or more water. If the batter becomes thick, then do add \u00bc to \u2153 cup more hot water. So do keep some hot water handy.\n15.\u00a0mix to a smooth batter. If there are small tiny lumps, then let it be. Do not over mix.\nBaking wheat cake\n16.\u00a0now pour the batter in the greased square pan.\n17. Gently shake the pan or tap the sides.\n18. Place the pan in a pre heated oven. Bake the wheat cake at 180 degrees celsius/356 degrees fahrenheit for 45 minutes to 1 hour. In my oven it took about 1 hour to bake. Yes that long. Oven temperatures are not same everywhere, so while baking do keep a check. Also please do not open the oven door till \u00be of the cake is done.\n19. Here\u2019s the whole wheat cake after baking.\u00a0the top should be golden and when you insert a tooth pick in the center of the cake, it should come out clean.\n20. Let the wheat cake become warm or cool completely, before you serve it. In cooler climates, the cake can be kept at room temperature for 1 to 2 days. Do store in a box. In warmer or hotter climates, refrigerate the cake. This wheat \u00a0 Cake stays good for about a week in the fridge.\nIf you are looking for more Cakes recipes then do check:\nVanilla cake\nEggless chocolate cake\nBlack forest cake\nHow to make cake without oven\nSTEP BY STEP PHOTOS ABOVE Many of my recipes have detailed step by step photos and useful tips to help you make it easily and perfectly.\nPIN\nPRINT\nWheat Cake\n4.95 from 36 votes\nAn easy recipe of cake made with whole wheat flour, sweetened condensed milk and butter.\nAuthor: Dassana Amit\nPrep Time: 10\nmins\nCook Time: 1\nhr\nTotal Time: 1\nhr\n10\nmins\nCourse: desserts\nCuisine: world\nServings (change the number to scale): 8\npieces\n(1 CUP = 250 ML)\nIngredients\ndry ingredients for wheat cake\n1\ncup\nwhole wheat flour\nor 120 grams whole wheat flour\n\u00bd\nteaspoon\nbaking powder\nwet ingredients for wheat cake\n\u00bd\ncup\nsweetened condensed milk\nor 125 ml or 125 grams sweetened condensed milk\n1\nteaspoon\nvanilla extract\nor \u00bd teaspoon vanilla essence\nfor butter solution\n80\ngrams\nunsalted butter\nor about \u2153 cup heaped chilled butter cubes. you can also use salted butter\n\u00bd\ncup\nwater\n4\ntablespoons\nsugar\nInstructions\nmaking wheat cake batter\nGrease a 6x6 inches square pan with softened butter.

I noted that when i added boiled syrup (butter+sugar +water) & mixed, the batter consistency was not loose like dosa batter, it was hard so i boiled little water & added to the batter to get the consistency, is this could be a reason for getting it fluffy & spongy. My mom\u2019s birthday is on 28th Aug, I want to make this cake for her, please help\ndassana amit\nAug 22, 2017\nshalini, depending on the quality of atta, less or more water will be needed. some types of atta absorb a lot of water. so you can use 3/4th cup water instead of 1/2 cup water in the recipe. this could be the reason for the cake to be dense. also use fresh baking powder. if the baking powder is not fresh, the cake will become dense. to check the freshness, dissolve a pinch of baking powder in some water and it should fizz and bubble. hope this helps. do let me know if you face any other issues.\nArpita Singhvi\nJul 31, 2017\nI want to bake a bigger cake since it lasts only a day or two.

Should I use only a borosil glass tray or aluminium cake moulds are okay.I have IFB Convection microwave..pl.let me know.\ndassana amit\nFeb 20, 2017\nsudha, you can make in the convection mode of your microwave oven. you can use either borosil glass tray or aluminium pans. but do note that with a glass pan, the baking time will increase as compared to aluminium pan. since glass is not a very good conductor of heat.\nnavneet\nFeb 12, 2017\nMy cake became dense n doughy. I guess i over mixed it. Can i use this cake in any other way now? Coz i don\u2019t want my family to eat this\ndassana amit\nFeb 12, 2017\nokay. try making cookies with it. it should work fine. or else if you see gluten strands, which means that the batter stretches like a dough, then knead very well to a dough. shape in small round shapes and bake them. they will taste like sweet crackers.\nIshita Kaneria\nFeb 07, 2017\nHello dassana, I made your whole wheat pound cake and it was very good. And i am planning to make this recipe. I am surprised here it says to add only baking powder, no baking soda is added. Will the cake turn out soft in absence of baking soda?\ndassana amit\nFeb 07, 2017\nthanks ishita. it does turn soft with baking powder. here there is no need to add baking soda as the amount of flour used is just 1 cup. both the condensed milk and butter does help in making the cake soft.\nPoornima\nFeb 02, 2017\nAwesome the cake came out really soft and spongy. It was done in 30 in my oven. I was wondering if I could replacing sugar with Maple Syrup. If so how much to add.\ndassana amit\nFeb 02, 2017\nThanks Poornima. I don\u2019t know how the cake will turn out. You have to experiment.\npooja mahajan\nFeb 02, 2017\nAlso I added vinegar & baking soda. Didn\u2019t have baking powder . N later even added some milk as the dough was very sticky\ndassana amit\nFeb 02, 2017\npooja, looks like the batter has got mixed too much. secondly baking soda or powder has to be fresh and not near its expiry date.\npooja mahajan\nFeb 02, 2017\nHi , mine turned out stiff & dense n not at all spongy / fluffy. Where did I went wrong ?\nkrupa\nJan 31, 2017\nIt turned out very dense \u2026 Donno where I went wrong \u2026 Can you please tell me\ndassana amit\nFeb 01, 2017\nkrupa, if the cake turns out dense then it could be because of baking powder may not be fresh. Or because of mixing the batter too much.\nkrupa\nFeb 03, 2017\nThanks I ll try again\ndassana amit\nFeb 03, 2017\nwelcome krupa.\nShwetha\nJan 31, 2017\nHi Dassana.

Cake tastes really awesome. But it has not come spongy. Top layer turned golden color but its hard. Also cake in middle is like halwa ;). What might be going wrong in my case?

Some thoughts here might help me in baking cake.\nThanks Shwetha Shwetha\ndassana amit\nFeb 01, 2017\nWelcome Shwetha. Thanks for your kind words. The cake is not cooked from the center.

if yes, then pls tell me what would be the measurements?\ndassana amit\nAug 18, 2019\nhi akshita, for a 3-litre pressure cooker you will have to use a slightly small pan that can fit in it. try using a pan which has more depth so that the cake batter when it bakes does not spill out.\nsince this cake recipe is made with 1 cup of flour, you can easily make it without changing the ingredients. the method of adding salt and removing the gasket & whistle will be the same. if the pan you use is small, then halve the recipe ingredients. hope this helps.\nMegha\nMar 27, 2019\nHi i had triedthis cake n ur choclate cake also came out too gud n taste also excellnt jus wana ask if i dntvhv vanilla extract or essence wat substitute we can put in that coz its not availble here in darjeeling n 30 mar is my husb bdy wana prepare choclate cake or ne other cake witout vanilla esence if u can suggest that to cooker cake plzz help\ndassana amit\nMar 27, 2019\nthanks megha. for chocolate cake, you don\u2019t need to add anything. but in the chocolate cake, to get a slight coffee flavor, you can add about 2 teaspoons of coffee. in the sponge cake, you can add cardamom powder \u2013 about 1/2 to 1 teaspoon, depending on how much cardamom aroma you want in the cake. plus a generous pinch of nutmeg powder can also be added.\nSourav\nMar 24, 2019\nThanks ????\nRehamansoor\nFeb 06, 2019\nVery nice recipe. \u2026 canwe avoid condense milk.nd add only sugar after melting ?plz ans me\ndassana\nFeb 06, 2019\ncondensed milk is required in the recipe. with sugar only the entire recipe and method will change.\nIshita kaneria\nFeb 05, 2019\nCan we bake with the same recipe and ingredients and measurements in oven?\ndassana\nFeb 05, 2019\nyes you can bake this eggless sponge cake in an oven. bake at 180 degrees celsius and preheat oven at the same temperature for 15 mins before baking.\nManali Purkayastha\nJan 29, 2019\nI tried to make this cake.it tasted good but the base became a little crisp.I kept for almost 1 hour as my cake pan is heavy. Can you please suggest me how can I bake this without getting a crisp base?\ndassana\nJan 30, 2019\neven while cooking, especially slow or prolonged cooking a heavy pan will always give a crispy base. so i would suggest to use a medium weight pan \u2013 not heavy and not light \u2013 kind of between. again in a heavy pan, the cooking takes more time as the density of the metal is more. so the heat is slowly conducted. this results in the food getting cooked slowly and this slow cooking over a prolonged period makes the base of the food crispy.\nSayanika ghosh\nJan 28, 2019\nI used all the ingredients as mentioned above. Cake did not baked properly inspite baking for 1 and half hour. Top layer of the cake did not turn golden. What could be the reason? BTW I have used regular metal pot instead of baking tin.\ndassana\nJan 30, 2019\nif the cake batter is mixed too much, the cake won\u2019t rise and also it looks like the cake is not baked, but actually, the cake is baked. it will be more like a dense doughy (atta like) structure inside the cake. the top will be uneven and won\u2019t have a uniform golden color. the pressure cooker cake method shown here works. for eggless cake batters, its always better to lightly mix them and do not over mix or over fold them. gluten strands are formed and they ruin the light spongy texture of the cake. regards to the pan \u2013 any metal pan works fine, but a baking pan is always better. hope this helps.\nSwa\nOct 17, 2018\nIf I plan to use condensed milk instead of eggs in a cake. How much should I substitute?\ndassana amit\nOct 17, 2018\ni have used condensed milk instead of eggs. are you mentioning any other specific cake?\nMalvika\nFeb 17, 2018\ncan we put some choclate chips in the cake batter?\ndassana amit\nFeb 18, 2018\nMalvika, yes you can add chocolate chips in the cake batter.\nMadhavi\nJan 27, 2018\nmam cooker cake recipe was really nice plz let me the ingredients that can be used instead of butter & condensed milk thanks\ndassana amit\nJan 28, 2018\nmadhavi oil can be used instead of butter. for condensed milk, there are substitutes like curd, tofu etc that can be used. but the proportion of sugar and water will change. the recipe needs to be tested and tried.\nVeena\nDec 28, 2017\nHi dassana. Thank you for all your recipes. They\u2019ve always been the best \ud83d\ude42 I had one doubt, can I bake all your cakes in a similar manner in pressure cooker??\ndassana amit\nDec 28, 2017\nwelcome veena. not all the cake recipes posted on website can be baked in pressure cooker. if the batter is on the thinner side, then such recipes do not work in a pressure cooker. either they take a long time and sometimes even after 2 hours of baking, they are not done. cake recipes where the batter thick to medium consistency can be baked in a pressure cooker.\nDeepika\nDec 19, 2017\nIs there any difference in final baked cake while baking in pressure cooker and oven\u2026\u2026since ingredients used are different in each case\u2026thx.\ndassana amit\nDec 19, 2017\nthere is a difference and its the time taken. in pressure cooker, the baking is faster than in an oven. also in a pressure cooker, its better to have a slightly thick or medium consistency of batter than what is required in an oven.\nvininandhu\nDec 13, 2017\nhi , thanks for the recipe can I replace condensed milk with sugar also can u please let me know where do u buy that organic cane sugar.\ndassana amit\nDec 13, 2017\nwelcome vininandhu. condensed milk will be required for the recipe. so you can\u2019t replace with sugar. i buy from big basket or natures basket \u2013 24 letter mantra brand or conscious food brand.\nVini Nandhu\nDec 14, 2017\nThanks a lot for replying me..

For baking in oven, preheat oven at 180 degrees celsius for 15 minutes and then bake at the same temperature.\nZoya\nDec 08, 2017\nCan the crystal salt used for baking ,be used again for cooking?\ndassana amit\nDec 08, 2017\navoid using the salt for cooking as some salt crystals get browned or burned. keep it for baking only. i keep on reusing the same salt for baking when i have to bake in a pressure cooker.\nRekha jagadeesh\nNov 03, 2017\nHi! Thank you very much for your recipe. I tried it . Though it raised little not much as shown in your pic. Can i know where i could be wrong . Is it in mixing or baking powder.\ndassana amit\nNov 03, 2017\nwelcome rekha. could be both due to over mixing or the quality of baking powder. usually for eggless cake its always better to mix with light hands without much pressure coming from the hands. some tiny lumps are fine in the batter.\nShelly Gupta\nSep 12, 2017\nI baked a cake with the same ingredients and amount but it was hard.\ndassana amit\nSep 13, 2017\ndenseness in a cake can be due to overmixing the batter or using baking powder or baking soda which are not fresh. if the baking powder is not active, the entire cake will become dense. so its better to check the freshness of baking powder in some water. if it bubbles and fizzes the baking powder is fresh and can be used. if it does not, then discard it.\nAnuja\nSep 01, 2017\nHi. I Would like to know whether unsalted butter can be substituted by home made ghee?\ndassana amit\nSep 01, 2017\nAnuja, yes you can. but cake will have the aroma of ghee.\nSruthy\nAug 29, 2017\nDasanna, I always wanted to bake a cake and the procedure is sooooper easy..I wat to try it.I have all the ingredients.but I have crystal salt..is crystal salt and sea salt same?????plz reply.\ndassana amit\nAug 30, 2017\nsea salt is in the form of crystals. so i assume you have sea salt which are like crystals.\nKhushi\nAug 27, 2017\nMam can I use homemade condensed milk . And can I use refine instead of butter.\ndassana amit\nAug 27, 2017\nyou can use homemade condensed milk and even oil can be used.\nMonalisa\nJul 30, 2017\nfor oven baking time n temperature plz\ndassana amit\nJul 30, 2017\n180 degrees celsius. time will vary from oven to oven. so take an approx time of 20 to 30 minutes. preheat oven at 180 degrees celsius for 15 minutes before baking.\nameena\nJul 30, 2017\nHey Thanks for responding. For some reason I couldn\u2019t find my own comment:).\ndassana amit\nJul 30, 2017\nwelcome ameena. if you refresh the page, you will see the comment.\nAmeena\nJul 27, 2017\nDassana I tried this recipe last week in oven and it tasted very nice. thanks for sharing, I like your way of making cakes without using any blender. Hey for some reason my cakes get burned on top, am new to baking and using oven. what is this upper heating and lower heating thing. pl\ndassana amit\nJul 27, 2017\nWelcome Ameena. Do not use the top heating element when baking for small ovens. If the oven is big then using top heating element is fine. But for small oven the top will get browned or burnt. you can use aluminium foil or butter paper on top of the pan in order to avoid the cake getting burnt.\nAmulya\nJul 26, 2017\nThanks a lot for the recipe \ud83d\ude42 The measurements you give are so correct and can be blindly followed. I\u2019m new to baking and my second attempt with this recipe was successful \ud83d\ude42 In my first attempt I added vanilla essence to flour and it formed black lumps and even after vigorous mixing they didn\u2019t bind with the flour. My suggestion to other would be to add vanilla essence in liquid mixture.\ndassana amit\nJul 27, 2017\nWelcome Amulya. Thanks for your suggestion. You don\u2019t need to mix too much, if the lumps form. As when you add other liquid ingredients then the lumps dissolves. But your suggestion is good and will help readers.\nSiya Bhat\nJul 25, 2017\nHi! Have you tried with fruits like banana?? I always try experimenting with cooking.. can you guide in this? Banana cake in cooker\ndassana amit\nJul 25, 2017\nsiya, i have never tried making fruit based cakes in cooker, but some readers have tried fruit based cake recipes posted on website in their pressure cookers.\nMonisha Mohanan\nJun 27, 2017\nHi Dassana, I made this\u2026but it came out like a pudding. The top layer got burnt may be because of high temperature.it tasted good\u2026but my concern is what went wrong through out in baking this cake. I followed your entire recipe\u2026\ndassana amit\nJun 27, 2017\nmonisha, looks like the cake batter was too mixed too much and thus the consistency like that of a pudding. the batter has to be mixed very lightly and with less pressure. if the batter is mixed too much or if it is thick, then gluten strands develop in the batter and this ruins the texture of the cake. the burning is also due to this problem. next time just mix lightly and do not over do the mixing. with eggless cake batters, it always better to do light mixing and folding.\nJoyce calvin\nJun 26, 2017\nI love it thank u so much\ndassana amit\nJun 26, 2017\nthanks joyce.\nfathi shaf\nJun 05, 2017\nCan i cook this in electric pressure cooker?

(1) Some say warm milk will not help in rising the cake and some say warm milk should be used (2) in place of condensed milk how much sugar should be used when we are taking 1 cup maida and if we want to make it using oil in place of butter then how much\ndassana amit\nMay 19, 2017\nsubha, warm or hot milk helps the cake in giving soft texture. rising depends on the leavening agent used and not warm milk. you can use 1/2 cup water instead of condensed milk. but in this case, don\u2019t use baking powder. add baking soda. 1/3rd teaspoon should be fine without getting the baking soda aroma in the cake. oil can be 1/4th cup. also i would suggest to add some lemon juice or vinegar here. so you can add 1/2 tablespoon of lemon juice or vinegar. add lemon juice once you switch off the flame and mix well. avoid adding milk as lemon or vinegar can curdle the milk, hence i have suggested adding water.\nMona\nFeb 25, 2017\nHi dassana , can l bake the cake in air fryer\ndassana amit\nFeb 25, 2017\nMona, You can try.

pineapple with detailed photo and video recipe. a unique and fancy tasty eggless cake recipe made with pineapple slices topped on top of baked pineapple or vanilla flavoured plum cake. it is a popular cake recipe not just because of it is taste, but also for the fact that the pineapple slices are topped and baked. it is a perfect dessert recipe which is not only liked by kids by all the age groups.\npineapple upside down cake recipe | pineapple cake | upside down pineapple with step by step photo and video recipe. eggless cakes recipes are extremely popular across india due to the fact that there are many strict vegetarian followers even without the use of egg yolk. it is typically made with baking soda and baking powder which helps to expand and also to hold the shape of cake recipe. one such easy and popular cake is pineapple upside-down cake recipe known for its pineapple flavour and taste.\nif you have observed this cake recipe, the pineapple slices are topped on top this normal cake. but its not baked as its with slices on top of it. the slices are stacked to the base and side of the baking tray. once it is stacked, the cake batter is poured on top of it and baked as any cake. once the cake is baked, it is then served upside down with pineapple slices at the top of the cake. baking the pineapples slices at the bottom of the cake helps to release the juice of pineapple and also get infused to the cake. moreover, it also gets caramelized when it gets in touch with sugar syrup and thus forming an ideal and unique cake recipe. it feels like it is a simple and easy procedure, but takes extra precaution while preparing this cake recipe.\nfurthermore, i would also like to highlight some tips, suggestions and variations for a perfect pineapple upside down cake recipe . firstly, for this recipe, i would heavily recommend using fresh and juicy pineapple slices. yet i have used canned pineapple slices as i did not have access to the fresh one. the canned ones are sliced to the same size and hence it helps to stack and arrange in the baking tray. secondly, the most preferred cake batter for this recipe is the plain vanilla-flavoured cake or pineapple flavoured batter. do not try to attempt the cake with any other cake flavour as it may overpower the pineapple flavour. lastly, try to arrange the pineapple slices in a symmetric way so that it looks attractive. also fill in the gap with bright coloured cherry to make it even more attractive.\nfinally, i request you to check my other related eggless cakes recipes collection with this post of

Basically white sauce is prepared from a roux of butter and flour.\nPreparing white sauce is pretty simple and easy . white sauce was amongst those recipes which we were taught quite early in our home science course and it was expected from us that we made it perfectly.\nGet My Secrets to Great Indian Food\nSign up for my FREE Beginners Guide to Delicious Indian Cooking\nThe recipe obviously comes from my home science notes. I use the same proportions of butter, milk and flour till today. I had got some recipe requests for white sauce and it took me a long time to share this recipe.\nUsually I prepare the sauce first and use it straightaway in any dish that I am making. I prepare the sauce both with all purpose flour (maida) and whole wheat flour (atta). In this post, I have made white sauce with whole wheat flour. Though I have mentioned the amount of all purpose flour that can be used.\nOn occasions I have also made the sauce with almond milk. So if you or your family members are a vegan or allergic to dairy, you can use almond milk. Substitute butter with olive oil or any neutral flavored oil.\nThe recipe gives a medium bowl of medium thick white sauce and can be used for pasta dishes like White sauce pasta ,\u00a0 Veg pasta or\u00a0baked dishes like Mac and cheese .\nHow to make white sauce\n1. Heat a saucepan. Keep the flame to a low and add 2 tablespoons butter. You can use salted or unsalted butter.\n2. When the butter melts and starts to bubble, then add 1 tablespoon whole wheat flour (atta) or 2 tablespoon all purpose flour (maida).\n3. Using a wired whisk stir the flour quickly as soon as you add it. Keep on stirring so that no lumps are formed.\u00a0the frequent stirring helps the flour to cook evenly.\u00a0you will see the flour frothing and bubbling up while stirring. Saut\u00e9 the flour till you get a nice cooked aroma from the flour and a pale golden color. Don\u2019t brown the flour.\n4.\u00a0keep the flame to the lowest and then pour 1 cup chilled milk in a gentle stream. Pour the milk with one hand and stir the sauce mixture with the other. The milk has to be chilled, so that lumps are not formed. If you use hot or warm milk or milk at room temperature, lumps can be formed.\n5. Do stir frequently while the milk warms and heats up.\n6. On a low flame, simmer the sauce till it thickens.\n7. When the sauce has thickened well and coats the back of a spoon, switch off the flame.\n8. Keep the saucepan down and add the seasonings \u2013 \u00bc teaspoon black pepper powder, a generous pinch of nutmeg powder or grated nutmeg and salt as required. For a cheese sauce, you can add 2 tablespoons of grated cheddar cheese.\n9. Mix very well.\n10. The white sauce is ready and can be used for pasta or baked veggie dishes or Soups . do note that on cooling white sauce will thicken more. So you can keep the consistency accordingly.\nSTEP BY STEP PHOTOS ABOVE Many of my recipes have detailed step by step photos and useful tips to help you make it easily and perfectly.\nPIN\nPRINT\nWhite Sauce\n4.5 from 4 votes\nWhite sauce recipe for pasta.

I cannot let go of the whole cheese block go waste. Considering one block of organic cheese costs a lot of money. I also cannot add the cheese to his sandwiches or toast.\nSo I think and think and decide to make these savory Whole wheat cheddar cheese biscuits .\nAm sure if I make anything else with the cheese like bread or croissants or anything\u2026 I know it will be just lying in the fridge..\nFortunately for me, the biscuits had a wonderful cheesy aroma much different than the original handmade cheese and the hubby ate them nicely without making any faces.\nThe taste and aroma of a handmade cheese is way different from regular cheese and no animal products like renin are used to culture the cheese.\nThe vegetarian cheese is cultured with vegetable enzymes. So always check for the details on a packet before buying cheese.\nThese biscuits taste like cheese straws and are a different type\u00a0altogether\u00a0than my earlier post on Cheese biscuits . the old post was the American style cheese biscuits where the biscuits are not crisp but soft like bread.\nI have adapted the recipe from my recipe notes and the same recipe with another variation is already on the Cheese straws post.\nI made a few cheese straws and many biscuits from the dough. They were a bit spicy with lots of red chili powder and black pepper powder.\nCrisp, buttery and smooth biscuits make an ideal option with ginger tea or filter coffee.

Pretty easy and simple to make. Tomatoes and cheese pair very well in any recipe.\nGet My Secrets to Great Indian Food\nSign up for my FREE Beginners Guide to Delicious Indian Cooking\nUsually, I toast or grill these sandwiches in an electric toaster or grill. In the post I have shown how to grill the sandwich on a tawa. So if you do not have toaster or grill, then also you can easily make these sandwiches on a tawa (skillet) or pan.\nServe these tomato cheese sandwiches with any dip or tomato sauce or chutney. You can also accompany some potato chips or banana wafers\u00a0or potato wedges\u00a0by the side.\nHow to make cheese and tomato sandwich\n1. Firstly take the slices of bread and spread some butter on them. You can use Wheat bread or multi grain bread or Brown bread or White bread .\n2. Then place 3 to 4 slices of tomatoes.\n3. Add grated cheddar cheese. You can add less or more as per your requirements. But do not add too much or over stuff with cheese and then the cheese melts on tawa and makes a mess.\n4. Sprinkle, dried herbs like oregano and basil. You can also use dried mix herbs. Also sprinkle some black pepper powder or freshly crushed black pepper\u00a0and\u00a0red chili flakes. You can also sprinkle some salt if you want.\n5. Cover with the second buttered slice.\n6. Heat a pan or tawa and brush some butter on it.\n7. Place the tomato and cheese sandwich on the tawa and gently move it around so that it soaks up the butter.\n8. Place a plate or lid on it. On top of the plate place a heavy weight like mortar or a heavy bowl. Or you could just use a heavy plate or tray.\n9. When the bottom bread is grilled well, then remove the lid and heavy weight. Brush some butter on top side. With this method the sandwiches get grilled fast, so do check with a spatula if the bottom bread is grilled well or not.\n10. With a spatula turn over the sandwich. You will see the crisp and grilled\u00a0side facing you.\n11. Place the lid and heavy weight again and grill\u00a0till the bottom bread is golden.\n12. Remove and serve grilled cheese and tomato sandwich hot or warm.\nYou can serve these tomato and cheese sandwiches with any dip or sauce or chutney.

Also what is the difference between processed,mozzarella and cheddar cheese like how do we differentiate when we purchase them and how do we decide for like which category of cheese has to be used for which food ?\nThanks\ndassana amit\nApr 17, 2017\nWelcome Megh\u00e0. You can use cheese slices. I don\u2019t use because we don\u2019t like the taste of cheese slices. The difference in the various types of cheese is the preparation and method and the culturing. Read the cheese label before buying. on google you will get to know the process in details on how these various cheese are made and where they can be used. most of the times i mention which type of cheese to be used in the recipe.\nYamuna Elango\nApr 15, 2017\nHi, I liked the way you have placed a heavy bowl on the plate.

tandoor till it gets baked. the charcoal would infuse the smoky flavour to the bread and thus making it an appetite bread. yet, you would have a strong craving to relish this naan bread at home. and also may think that naan bread recipes are limited to posh fine-dine restaurants. well you might be surprised that the garlic naan can also be made at home using tawa. also i haven\u2019t used yeast to make it puffy and used baking powder to have the same effect. hence this should be must try the recipe and enjoy the garlic bread naan at home.\nfurthermore, i would like to mention some tips, suggestions and variations for a perfect garlic naan recipe . firstly, i have used baking powder for proofing the plain flour dough. well traditional recipe includes yeast for proofing and you can use it if you are comfortable using it. secondly, you can make the same naan bread using a big sized cooker. as a matter of fact, you can use cooker as tandoor and stick the bread to the sides of the cooker and heat it upside down. lastly, because it is maida, it becomes chewy if it is rested for a while. it is recommended to serve it immediately with a choice of curry.\nfinally, i would like to highlight my other roti and naan recipes collection with this post garlic naan recipe . it mainly includes recipes like rumali roti , akki roti , ragi rotti , bajra roti , jolada rotti , tandoori roti on tawa , sabudana thalipeeth , jowar roti , akki roti with cooked rice , missi roti . in addition, to these i would like to mention my other detailed recipes collection like,\npaneer recipes

Thanks once again. I tried this for the first time but it turned out to be too bitter and none like it:( even I did not feel to have second sip .. what might be reason? What care should be taken so that it don\u2019t turn bitter\u2026\ndassana amit\nSep 24, 2017\nthanks a lot shweta. if the avocado are not ripe, then they have some bitterness in them. while making any dish with avocado always use ripe ones. the ripe avocado, has a scoop able flesh just like soft butter. usually the avocados we buy are not ripe. so keep them on the kitchen counter for some days and let them ripen. you can wrap them in a cotton napkin, paper if you want. unripe avocado has such a different taste that you cannot eat anything made with it. ripe avocado is not bitter. for checking the ripeness, just press the skin gently with a finger or thumb and the skin should yield easily. if the skin feels tight, then the avocado is not ripe. the skin also changes color when the avocado ripens.\nchandra\nJan 12, 2015\nHello, i would like to know, when i prepare avocado using milk and sugar wehn its standing it turn brown but when u mix it up again its green, how do i prevent this from turning brown.\nthanks\ndassana amit\nJan 12, 2015\nwelcome chandra. yes it happens. you need to add some drops of lime juice to stop the avocado from turning brown. but i would not advise adding lime juice in a milkshake. so better to drink the milkshake fresh.. otherwise the avocado darkens.\nAshwini\nAug 21, 2014\nI have made this quite many times,minus the cocoa nibs,and have been happy with the results.Had a doubt,does keeping this milkshake in the refrigerator turn it bitter?\ndassana amit\nAug 21, 2014\ni think it won\u2019t turn bitter. but avocado has to be had fresh.\nmenu\nHome\nRecipes Index\nBy Ingredients\nBhindi (Okra)\nBrinjal (Eggplant)\nCabbage\nCapsicum\nCauliflower\nChickpeas\nFenugreek\nMushroom\nPaneer Recipes\nGreen Peas\nSpinach\nPotato\nBy Indian Cuisine\nAndhra Recipes\nBengali Recipes\nGoan Recipes\nGujarati Recipes\nHyderabadi Recipes\nKarnataka Recipes\nKashmiri Recipes\nKerala Recipes\nKonkan Recipes\nMaharashtrian Recipes\nNorth Indian Food\nPunjabi Recipes\nSouth Indian Food\nUttar Pradesh Cuisine\nTamil Nadu Recipes\nBreakfast\nEasy Breakfast\nIdli\nDosa Varieties\nParatha Recipes\nSnacks\nStarters & Snacks\nStreet Food\nEvening Snacks\nBread Snacks\nPakora Recipes\nSandwich Recipes\nSweets & Desserts\nBurfi (Fudge)\nCookies\nDesserts\nEggless Cakes\nIce Cream\nHalwa Recipes\nKheer and Payasam\nLadoo Recipes\nSweets\nBeverages\nBeverages\nJuices\nMilkshakes\nSmoothie\nTea & Coffee\nRice\nIndian Rice Recipes\nPulao Recipes\nBiryani Varieties\nMain Course\nVegetables\nCurry\nDal (Lentils) & Legumes\nSambar\nPasta Recipes\nPizza Recipes\nIndian Breads\nIndian Chinese\nBread Recipes\nInstant Pot\nAccompaniments\nChutney Recipes\nPickles\nRaita Recipes\nSalad Recipes\nRasam Varieties\nSoup Recipes\nSpecial Diet\nVegan Recipes\nGluten Free Recipes\nLow Fat Recipes\nSatvik \u2013 No Onion NO Garlic\nNavratri & Fasting Recipes\nDIY\nSpice Mix\nCondiment\nDIY\nAbout\nfree email series\nGet My Secrets to Great Indian Food\nSign up for my FREE Beginners Guide to Delicious Indian Cooking\nFIND A RECIPE\nSearch for:\nNamaste.

Here I have used skinned beans where the thin translucent cover from the beans are removed. This is done by lightly pressing and squeezing the beans. Thus the name\u00a0hitikida avarekalu sagu in Karnataka language, where The word \u2018hitikida\u2019 means pressed or squeezed. This butter beans curry has complex flavors and tastes very good with pooris or chapatis.\nAvarekalu is easily available during winters and there are many regional Indian recipes in which they are added. In Gujarat, maharashtra and Karnataka many dishes are made with these beans. They are also called as mochai in tamil language, pavta in marathi language and surti lilva in Gujarati language.\nGet My Secrets to Great Indian Food\nSign up for my FREE Beginners Guide to Delicious Indian Cooking\nShelling the beans from the pods takes time. Then some more time is also spend in skinning the beans. So its better to take some help while doing so. You can also use frozen and packed beans to make this sagu.\nI have used my Mix veg saagu recipe to make this tasty gravy with some changes. I avoid adding garlic, onion and tomatoes as I feel adding them overpowers the taste and flavor of the beans. But feel free to add them if you want. I have used pressure cooker to cook the beans. You can also cook in a pan or pot.\nAvarekalu sagu recipe is best served with pooris or chapatis. You can also serve with ragi mudde or Neer dosa or Sponge dosa \u00a0or Aval dosa \u00a0or Thayir dosa .\nIf you want to check few more curry recipes then have a look at:\nVegetable korma\nVal usal\nDrumstick curry\nPoricha kuzhambu\nSTEP BY STEP PHOTOS ABOVE Many of my recipes have detailed step by step photos and useful tips to help you make it easily and perfectly.\nPIN\nPRINT\nAvarekalu Sagu Recipe\n5 from 1 vote\nAvarekalu sagu is a creamy delicious gravy made with fresh butter beans from Karnataka cuisine.\u00a0these beans are also called as mochai in tamil language, pavta in marathi language and surti lilva in Gujarati language.\nAuthor: Dassana Amit\nPrep Time: 15\nmins\nCook Time: 15\nmins\nTotal Time: 30\nmins\nCourse: main course\nCuisine: karnataka,south indian\nServings (change the number to scale): 5\n(1 CUP = 250 ML)\nIngredients\nfor pressure cooking:\n2\ntablespoons\noil\n\u00bd\nteaspoon\nmustard seeds\n8 to 10\ncurry leaves\n1\npinch\nasafoetida\n(hing)\n2\nmedium potatoes\n- chopped in large pieces (optional)\n\u00be to 1\ncup\nskinned avarekalu,\nbutter beans, surti lilva, pavta, mochai\n1\ncup\nwater\nsalt\nas required\nfor green masala paste:\n\u00bc\ncup\ngrated fresh coconut\n\u00bc\ncup\nchopped coriander leaves\n1\ninch\nginger\n- chopped\n2\ngreen chilies\n- chopped\n1\ntablespoon\nroasted chana dal\n1\ntablespoon\ncoriander seeds\n(sabut dhania)\n1\nteaspoon\ncumin seeds\n(jeera)\n1\nteaspoon\npoppy seeds\n1\ninch\ncinnamon\n(dalchini)\n1\ngreen cardamom\n2\ncloves\n(lavang)\n\u00bc to \u2153\ncup\nwater for grinding\nother ingredients:\n1 to 2\ntablespoons\nchopped coriander leaves\nfor garnish\nto be served with:\n1 small lemon,\nchopped\nInstructions\nskinning beans (avarekalu):\nSoak 1.25 to 1.5 cups shelled beans (avarekalu) in enough water for a couple of hours.

Soak 1.25 to 1.5 cups shelled beans (avarekalu) in enough water for a couple of hours. Or you can soak them overnight in the fridge.\n2. Later drain all the water.\n3. Remove the outer sheath or cover from the beans (avarekalu). Just press the avarekalu and the outer cover comes out easily.\n4. Do this with all the beans. Its a minute work. So consider it as a zen meditation ????\n5. Remove the outer husks in a separate plate and then discard them. You will need \u00be to 1 cup of the skinned beans. I usually skin the beans and then freeze them for a couple of days.\nPressure cooking beans (avarekalu)\n6. Heat\u00a02 tablespoons oil in a 2 litre pressure cooker. Add\u00a0\u00bd teaspoon mustard seeds and let them crackle.\n7. Keep flame to a low. Then add 8 to 10 curry leaves and\u00a01 pinch asafoetida (hing). Stir and mix. At this step you can add 1 small to medium tomato (chopped) if you want. Then saut\u00e9 chopped tomatoes till they soften.\n8. Then add\u00a0\u00be to 1 cup skinned avarekalu. Also add\u00a02 medium potatoes, chopped in large pieces.potatoes are optional and can be skipped.\n9. Mix well.\n10. Add 1 cup water.\n11. Season with salt as required.\n12. Pressure cook for 1 to 2 whistles on medium flame or for 5 to 6 minutes on medium flame.\nC) making green masala paste:\n13. When the avarekalu and potatoes are cooking you can make the masala paste. In a grinder jar, take\u00a0\u00bc cup grated fresh coconut,\u00a01 inch ginger (chopped),\u00a02 green chilies (chopped),\u00a01 tablespoon roasted chana dal and 1 teaspoon poppy seeds. Skip poppy seeds and roasted chana dal if you do not have them.\n14. Now add\u00a01 tablespoon coriander seeds,\u00a01 teaspoon cumin seeds,\u00a01 inch cinnamon,\u00a01 green cardamom,\u00a02 cloves and\u00a0\u00bc cup chopped coriander leaves.\n15. Add\u00a0\u00bc to \u2153 cup water and grind to a smooth fine paste. Keep aside.\nMaking\u00a0avarekalu sagu\n16. When the pressure in the cooker falls down on its own, open the lid of the cooker.\n17. Add the ground green masala paste.\n18. Mix very well and keep the cooker on stove top on a low to medium-low flame.\n19. Simmer\u00a0avarekalu sagu gravy for 8 to 10 minutes stirring at intervals. If the gravy becomes thick, then you can add some more water. When cooking the sagu gravy will become more thick. If the gravy splutters, then cover cooker partly with its lid and simmer. Do check the taste and add more salt if required.\n20. Garnish\u00a0avarekalu sagu with some chopped coriander leaves. Also sprinkle some lemon juice on top. Or you can serve lemon wedges as a side when serving this\u00a0butter beans curry. Some sour lemony hints really enhances the taste of\u00a0hitikida avarekalu sagu. Serve avarekalu sagu with chapatis or pooris.\u00a0you can also serve with ragi mudde, neer dosa or set dosa.\nCategories Curry Recipes , Karnataka Recipes , Satvik - No Onion NO Garlic , South Indian Food , Vegan Recipes\nPost navigation\nTrending Recipes\nEggless Chocolate Cake (Whole Wheat)\ncooker cake | sponge cake in pressure cooker\nWhole Wheat Banana Cake (Eggless and Vegan)\nbest gulab jamun \u2013 2 ways\nBest Punjabi Samosa Recipe\nwheat cake | eggless wheat flour cake\nEasy Pani Puri\n50 tasty besan recipes (gram flour or chickpea flour recipes)\nSoft Whole Wheat Bread | 100% Wholemeal Bread from Scratch (Eggless)\nchivda recipe\n30 Popular Indian Breakfast Recipes for Foodies\nBhatura Recipe (Bhature without yeast)\nyogurt recipes | curd recipes | 30 indian recipes with yogurt or curd\npuri recipe for golgappa or pani puri or puchka\nmomos recipe | dim sum | veg momos\n20 easy and simple eggless cakes recipes\nTomato Puree (Homemade & Without Preservatives)\noats recipes | 14 oatmeal recipes | easy oats recipes for breakfast or snack\n20 popular indian dinner recipes | lunch recipes\nPaneer Butter Masala (Restaurant Style)\nhow to make cake without oven | cake recipes without oven\n65 Whole Wheat recipes | Tasty recipes with whole wheat flour (Chapati Atta)\nrava recipes | 35 sooji recipes | sweets and snacks made with semolina\nEasy No Yeast Pizza Dough (Vegan)\n21 ripe banana recipes | easy banana dessert recipes\n35 Best Indian Rice Recipes\n91 delicious paneer recipes\nGet My Secrets to Great Indian Food\nSign up for my FREE Beginners Guide to Delicious Indian Cooking\nDassana Amit\nnamaste and welcome to vegrecipesofindia.com which i started in feb 2009 and is a pure vegetarian blog. i have been passionate about cooking from childhood and began to cook from the age of 10. later having enrolled in a home science degree greatly enhanced my cooking & baking skills and took it to a different level which i now share as foolproof recipes. i was formally trained both in mainstream indian as well as international cuisines.\nAbout Dassana Amit\nComments are closed.\n2 comments/reviews\nGeetha\nJan 25, 2018\nHi Dassana, I am originally from Bangalore, and was delighted to see the hitikida avarekalu sagu recipe here. Thanks for posting it. I grew up eating this delicious curry in winters. The version we made at home however never had potatos in it. Also, I would like to add onions, garlic and tomatoes. Should I grind the onion and tomatoes along with the green paste, or add them just after mustard seeds? I now live in London, and we have canned butter beans available here throughout the year. Your recipe has now inspired me to cook them!\ndassana amit\nJan 25, 2018\nthank you geetha. potatoes are optional. i forgot to mention in the post. will update. i have to add potatoes in most of the recipes i make as without them i have few takers in the family ????\nfor adding onion, garlic and tomatoes, its better to saut\u00e9 after adding mustard seeds as we are not cooking the paste for a long time after adding it. for garlic, you can add garlic paste which has been crushed in a mortar-pestle. saut\u00e9 garlic well so that raw aroma goes away.\nmenu\nHome\nRecipes Index\nBy Ingredients\nBhindi (Okra)\nBrinjal (Eggplant)\nCabbage\nCapsicum\nCauliflower\nChickpeas\nFenugreek\nMushroom\nPaneer Recipes\nGreen Peas\nSpinach\nPotato\nBy Indian Cuisine\nAndhra Recipes\nBengali Recipes\nGoan Recipes\nGujarati Recipes\nHyderabadi Recipes\nKarnataka Recipes\nKashmiri Recipes\nKerala Recipes\nKonkan Recipes\nMaharashtrian Recipes\nNorth Indian Food\nPunjabi Recipes\nSouth Indian Food\nUttar Pradesh Cuisine\nTamil Nadu Recipes\nBreakfast\nEasy Breakfast\nIdli\nDosa Varieties\nParatha Recipes\nSnacks\nStarters & Snacks\nStreet Food\nEvening Snacks\nBread Snacks\nPakora Recipes\nSandwich Recipes\nSweets & Desserts\nBurfi (Fudge)\nCookies\nDesserts\nEggless Cakes\nIce Cream\nHalwa Recipes\nKheer and Payasam\nLadoo Recipes\nSweets\nBeverages\nBeverages\nJuices\nMilkshakes\nSmoothie\nTea & Coffee\nRice\nIndian Rice Recipes\nPulao Recipes\nBiryani Varieties\nMain Course\nVegetables\nCurry\nDal (Lentils) & Legumes\nSambar\nPasta Recipes\nPizza Recipes\nIndian Breads\nIndian Chinese\nBread Recipes\nInstant Pot\nAccompaniments\nChutney Recipes\nPickles\nRaita Recipes\nSalad Recipes\nRasam Varieties\nSoup Recipes\nSpecial Diet\nVegan Recipes\nGluten Free Recipes\nLow Fat Recipes\nSatvik \u2013 No Onion NO Garlic\nNavratri & Fasting Recipes\nDIY\nSpice Mix\nCondiment\nDIY\nAbout\nfree email series\nGet My Secrets to Great Indian Food\nSign up for my FREE Beginners Guide to Delicious Indian Cooking\nFIND A RECIPE\nSearch for:\nNamaste.

Iyengar bakery in bangalore is popular for some of their snacks like masala buns, butter biscuits, khara biscuits, sweet puffs and veg puffs. Veg masala toast is one of them. Eggless honey cake which I had shared earlier is also one of their fast selling cakes.\nIn this veg masala toast recipe, the toast is made similar to open toasts or sandwiches. The mix vegetable filling is placed on top of a crisp toasted bread and then served hot or warm. The slightly tangy, spiced and faintly sweet veggie filling tastes too good with crisp toasted bread. The tanginess in the veg filling comes from the addition of tomatoes. Onions and carrots contribute to a slightly sweetish taste. Capsicum is also added which gives an overall nice flavor to the entire filling.\nGet My Secrets to Great Indian Food\nSign up for my FREE Beginners Guide to Delicious Indian Cooking\nThe addition of mix vegetables in the filling make these masala bread toasts healthy if you use Whole wheat bread or multi grain bread.\u00a0for toasting the bread, I have used butter, though even oil can be used.\nI had bookmarked iyengar masala toast recipe from anupama\u2019s blog Easybitesonline \u00a0from a long time.

These eggless garlic bread rolls are made with whole wheat flour.\nThese garlic bread rolls were inspired from nag\u2019s blog Edible garden and ever since I saw them, I had to make them.\nGet My Secrets to Great Indian Food\nSign up for my FREE Beginners Guide to Delicious Indian Cooking\nAfter baking the garlic bread rolls , I have made different kinds of bread rolls many times\u2026 Like pesto rolls and cinnamon rolls. I have experimented making the rolls with a whole wheat bread dough, brown bread dough as well as pizza dough.\nLast time when I had made Focaccia , I had kept some part of the dough to make basil pesto rolls and they were too good.\u00a0any bread roll makes for a good brunch or a tea time snack. You can also check these similar recipes:\nCheese roll\nPaneer bread roll\nBread roll\nTo make these garlic bread rolls , I have used my own recipe. I have used here nutralite for making the garlic spread. You can use dairy butter or vegan butter. I still had some nutralite left after I had made the\u00a0 Garlic bread , so I decided to add them to these rolls.\nSince I am a visual person, I better understand in pictures when words such as rolling, folding etc are concerned. Pictures speak louder and larger than words.\u00a0along with nags, there is one more blog that helped me as far as illustrative pics are concerned\u2026 And that is divya\u2019s Easy cooking .\nThese garlic bread\u00a0rolls are made with whole wheat flour and just a little of all-purpose flour. But you can make them with all-purpose flour or with half-half of both.\nHow to make garlic bread rolls\n1: mix sugar and yeast in warm water. Allow to sit at room temperature for 10-12 mins.\n2: the yeast solution bubbled and frothy after 10 mins.\n3: add the flours, salt, oil to the bowl of yeast mixture.\n4: knead into a smooth, soft and springy dough.\n5: rub oil on the whole dough and keep covered for up to 1:30 to 2 hours until leavened.\n6: the dough after leavening.\nAssembling and shaping garlic bread rolls\n7: beat the butter and oil with a spoon till light and fluffy. Add all the spices, herbs and mix well.\n8: lightly punch the dough before making the rolls on a work surface.\n9: divide the dough into two parts.\n10: take one part of the dough and on a lightly dusted work surface, roll to a round or rectangle till the width reaches to 1/2 inch.\n11: \u00a0spread the garlic butter evenly on the dough.\n12: roll the dough till the end.\n13: \u00a0\u00a0make a similar roll with the second piece of the dough.\u00a0now both the rolls are ready to be sliced.\nMaking garlic bread rolls\n14: first give a cut from the center and then equally cut the two parts. So you have now 4 equal slices of the rolled dough spirals.\n15: grease a pan in which all the 8 rolls will fit. Place the rolls with the cut edges facing upwards in the pan. Brush their tops with remaining garlic butter.\u00a0cover and let the rolls double up for 30-40 minutes.\n16: bake in a pre heated oven for 30-35 minutes at 180 degrees C till the tops are golden and the garlic bread rolls sound hollow when tapped. Since I have a slow oven it took me 40 mins to bake the rolls. Serve them\u00a0warm with tea or coffee.\nOne more photo to inspire you to make these awesome and Delicious garlic bread rolls \ud83d\ude42\nFew more bread recipes for you!\nWheat bread\nVeg pizza\nPita bread\nBanana bread\nThin crust pizza\nSTEP BY STEP PHOTOS ABOVE Many of my recipes have detailed step by step photos and useful tips to help you make it easily and perfectly.\nPIN\nPRINT\nGarlic Bread Rolls\n4.87 from 15 votes\nSoft garlic bread rolls made with garlic herb butter.

Actually am a fan of your recipes. I want to know whether can I add mushrooms and capsicum to this recipe along with garlic and herbs\nMaria\ndassana amit\nAug 07, 2017\nthanks maria. you can add mushrooms and capsicum. just saute mushrooms in some oil till the moisture from them goes away and then add in the garlic spread. chop mushrooms finely. for capsicum also you can saute them in some oil or you can roast them in an oven. alternatively in a pan you first saute capsicum in some oil and then add mushrooms. continue to saute till all the water from the mushrooms evaporates and the mixture becomes dry. chop capsicum also finely.\nEkta\nMay 29, 2017\nHi, is there any substitute for yeast?? If any plz let me know\ndassana amit\nMay 29, 2017\nin this recipe there is no substitute for yeast.\nnahid\nDec 26, 2016\nHi I tried baking a garlic bread roll (whole log) in pressure cooker as detailed by u in ladi pav receipe \u2013 it\u2019s taken 1and 1/2 and still the top is not browned and don\u2019t know if it\u2019s cooked till the top and so I had to roll the log in the pan to get the other side browned Any suggestions where I might have gone wrong Also my pan is of the same height as the pressure cooker and the lid above it would that make a difference?\ndassana amit\nDec 26, 2016\nnahid, there should be some space between the pan and the top of the cooker. this helps in browning the bread or cake from top in the pressure cooker. it should not take so much time. just eat a small piece and see if it is baked well or not. i think the bread roll must have baked in this much time.\nSukanya\nDec 06, 2016\nHi Dassana,\nCan I add a bit of cheese along with the butter spread before i roll it?

Today my whole wheat bread broke while unmoulding . Could it be that it was still too warm ? Can you guide please .\nRenu\ndassana amit\nSep 19, 2016\nrenu, bread should always be removed when its completely cooled at room temperature. even at times i have tried to remove hot and warm breads and they have broken. so just let the loaf cool down and then you remove it from the pan.\ngood to know that rolls came out good. thanks renu \ud83d\ude42\nPriyanka\nJul 11, 2016\nHi Ma\u2019am. Your recipes are almost always fool proof and I love to try them out! \ud83d\ude42 My family is not a fan of garlic, so I want to try Cinnamon rolls. Have you posted a recipe for it? If not, will the dough recipe be the same as this one? And only the cinnamon filling will change?\nLove and thanks, Priyanka\ndassana amit\nJul 11, 2016\nthanks priyanka. i do plan to add cinnamon rolls. same dough recipe, but just sprinkle cinnamon + sugar on the dough. also spread some butter before sprinkling sugar + cinnamon mixture.\nPaulina\nMay 05, 2016\nI made these to pair up with lasagna. I have never before in my life actually made bread before, ever. It was very amusing watching the yeast do its\u2019 thing \ud83d\ude42 I think that I made my dough too thin when I was rolling it out but it didn\u2019t affect the taste or the look! Next time I wont roll out my dough so thin and my rolls will be a bit heftier like the ones in your picture. Since I was eating these with lasagna I added dried parsley and basil, I didn\u2019t have carom seeds or celery so I just omitted those. Unfortunately after I had put my bread in the oven I had to leave RIGHT after the 35 minutes so I turned off the oven and left my rolls in there because they looked like they still needed a little time, they got kind of crunchy on the outside but were soft and yummy on the inside. I will make these again and hopefully I won\u2019t have to leave them unattended again! Thank you for this easy-to-follow recipe \ud83d\ude42\ndassana amit\nMay 07, 2016\nthanks paulina. the more one bakes bread, the more one learns. even i have learned over a period of time \ud83d\ude42\nPooja\nFeb 04, 2016\nWithout using yeast can we make the bread?\ndassana amit\nFeb 04, 2016\nyes you can, but the method is longer and takes more time.\nPooja\nFeb 07, 2016\nPlease could you share that one ?\ndassana amit\nFeb 08, 2016\nwill do pooja. have got many requests for the same.\npooja\nAug 12, 2015\nHi! i have been reading ur blog for sometime now and keep trying something. today i made the garlic rolls and they came out very well. my daughter loves such food and i packed them up for her tiffin . thank u very much and keep writing\ndassana amit\nAug 12, 2015\nwelcome pooja. glad to know this. thanks for sharing positive feedback.\nArchana\nApr 04, 2015\nHi, tried the recipe today.

Add \u00bd cup semi solid ghee (at room temperature) or butter (at room temperature).\n4. With an electric mixer or blender, begin to\u00a0cream the sugar and butter.

All your recipes are explained in a very detailed way. Keep up the good work ????????Thanks\ndassana amit\nFeb 22, 2018\nthanks nita. you can overall add 1.25 cups maida. then you may not need to add milk or add very less milk just enough to bind the dough.\nTanu Rajendran\nJan 30, 2018\nThe cookies smelled great in the beginning, but the baking time is off. I did 18-minutes at 350degrees and that was just way too much; they were close to burned. I normally do my other cookies for about 12-15 minutes and will be remaking these with shortened bake time. I also recommend refrigerating the dough for about 30-minutes before baking. It helps solidify the fat and will prevent them from spreading so much when you bake them (as seems to be the problem for some folks).\ndassana amit\nJan 31, 2018\ntanu, timing varies from oven to oven. hence i always mention in my baking posts to keep a check while baking. some ovens bake faster and some take more time. the dough can be refrigerated. i have not mentioned nor do i refrigerate as traditionally for making nankhatais, dough is not refrigerated. but for people living in hot and humid climate zones, this is a good suggestion. thanks for sharing.\nDalia\nDec 24, 2017\nDear Dassana, The Nankhatais were excellent!!Thanks for emphasizing on the cream like consistency of the ghee. That was key I think. Have a Merry Christmas!! Love, Dalia\ndassana amit\nDec 24, 2017\nthanks dalia. glad to know. wish you a merry christmas and happy new year.\nJyoti\nNov 07, 2017\nHi, I tried your receipe today followed by each and every step exactly with accurate measurement\u2026but my nankhatai flattened and became biscuit shaped\u2026pls help\u2026\ndassana amit\nNov 07, 2017\njyoti, try not to make the size thin. depending on the quality of ghee or butter used, the nankhatais can flatten. even if they are made thin they will flatten. so you can just roll them like pedas and keep. when baking they will spread and flatten. hope this helps.\nAfff\nOct 03, 2017\nHi there Im gonna be making this recipe Hope i get my cracks same like yours????????????\ndassana amit\nOct 03, 2017\nAfff, I am sure you will like the taste of nankhatai.\nmeena\nSep 02, 2017\nmy nankhatai turned flat despite accurate measurements.pl guide\ndassana amit\nSep 02, 2017\nwhen making nankhatai do not flatten them too much. keep them thick. too much of fat can also flatten them.\nvedika\nJul 20, 2017\nhi dear all went well n great but why did my nankhatai flatten more than it should have and also why its breaking up after removing from the baking tray please advice\ndassana amit\nJul 21, 2017\nvedika, looks like the nankhatai has become too crumbly. did you make them thin. if yes then they will flatten more and become crumbly. the crumbliness also could be due to the quality of butter used.\nShabistan\nJul 15, 2017\nExcellent ! Kid and Husband just love it. Going to make second batch. Can I double the amount you mentioned in the recipe?\ndassana amit\nJul 15, 2017\nthanks shabistan for the feedback and glad to know that your family liked the nankhatais. of course you can double the amount. in case the mixture does not bind, then some more milk can be added.\nsabjot kaur\nJul 10, 2017\nhi dassana i hve made these cookies in pressure cooker and they are turn out super yummy and delicious..thankuu\ndassana amit\nJul 13, 2017\nwelcome sabjot. glad to know this.\nAkanksha Gupta\nJul 05, 2017\nI tried but instead of nan khatai they turned out to be excellent homemade cookies\u2026.i dont know which ingredient i have put more but still it tastes good!!!\ndassana amit\nJul 06, 2017\nThanks Akanksha. I can\u2019t say what went different. but glad that end result was good.\nSonal\nApr 27, 2017\nHey can I use hand blender the one that is use to make smoothies???\ndassana amit\nApr 27, 2017\nyou can use a hand blender.\nDeepa\nApr 18, 2017\nHi this is deepa,I follow the receipe but unfortunately the ghee and milk proportion was more than what u explain. So it gets very flat and oily after bake. But the dough is balance should I keep the dough in refrigerator and bake tomorrow. please help. Next time for this proportion can I take 100 grm Amul butter packet\ndassana amit\nApr 19, 2017\ndeepa, i have measured the proportions and given. these nankhatais are not oily. did you use the correct cup measurement (1 cup = 250 ml) or the correct grams measurement. you can refrigerate and bake later. also in summers, the dough will look greasy as the ghee will be in a melted form. 100 grams butter will be slightly too much. so you can remove 2 to 3 tablespoons from it and then use.\nRajni Andavarapu\nFeb 20, 2017\nHello mam , im a frequent visitor of ur website and i have done so many receipes and all came out very well , but this one don\u2019t know whr i went wrong i got my nan katais like papads tastes good but still not that crispy taste and all r flattened pls need ur suggestion , luv ur receipes with step by step pics very well explained by u thanq \u2026\ndassana amit\nFeb 20, 2017\nThanks Rajni. Looks like the ghee has become too much. thats why they have got flattened. do not shape them too thin. if they get over baked then they will have texture like papad. shape them slightly thick.\nSnehil\nJan 08, 2017\nThey are pretty good.

paneer recipe | shahi paneer masala | shahi paneer ki sabji\nBy\nHebbars Kitchen\n-\nJanuary 3, 2020\nthis post is also available in \u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940 (Hindi)\nshahi paneer recipe | shahi paneer masala | shahi paneer ki sabji with detailed photo and video recipe. a classical and premium north indian or punjabi curry made with paneer in dry fruit sauce. unlike other traditional paneer based curries, this curry is more creamy and sweet in taste due to the use of dry fruits. it is an ideal gravy based curry which can be easily served with choice of roti\u2019s, bread and also with rice options.\nshahi paneer recipe | shahi paneer masala | shahi paneer ki sabji with step by step photo and video recipe. paneer based curries are one of the popular choices for both meat and non-meat eaters in india. it can be made with a wide variety of options which includes spicy gravy, dry variant and a creamy sauce based curry. one such easy, simple and rich creamy based sauce curry is the shahi paneer masala known for its mild and sweet taste.\nas i mentioned in my previous paragraph, this recipe is a mild or less spicy paneer based curry. as the name suggests, shahi which means royal due to the use of cream in it. consequently, with the use of the cream, it would lower the spice level and thus offering a creamy and a rich paneer gravy. i personally not a huge fan of such mild gravy and i tend to order or make spicy kadai paneer or paneer tikka masala . yet there is a huge fan following who, particularly outside of india where many prefer less spicy meals. in addition to it, some prefer to have mild spicy and sweetness in their curry and this recipe is an ideal choice for them.\nanyway, before wrapping up some tips, suggestions and variations for shahi paneer ki sabji . firstly, in this recipe, i have used tomatoes and onions to prepare the creamy sauce. some prefer to use just onions and skip tomatoes to get the yellow colour. but i like my gravy to be reddish or orangish in colour and hence i have used both. secondly,you can also add cashews and almonds in terms of dry fruits. you can experiment and add more options like walnuts, macadamia nuts, sunflower seeds and pistachios. lastly, you can make the same gravy sauce and replace the paneer with other ingredients like mushroom and potatoes to make other variants. moreover, you can also use meat chunks to make meat-based shahi gravy.\ni have posted other similar paneer recipes collection which has a similar texture and taste to this shahi paneer masala recipe. it mainly includes recipes like, paneer hyderabadi , paneer ghee roast , paneer fried rice , paneer biryani , paneer butter masala , malai barfi , paneer frankie , matar paneer , paneer tikka masala , paneer chilla . further to these i would also like to highlight my other detailed recipes collection like,\ncurry or sabzi recipes\ndal recipes\nstreet food recipes\nshahi paneer video recipe:\nstreet food recipes

Only in the mango season, I prepare Mango cheesecake a couple of times.\nGet My Secrets to Great Indian Food\nSign up for my FREE Beginners Guide to Delicious Indian Cooking\nThis cheesecake was loved by the guests we had on this day. The recipe gives you a medium sized cheesecake which is good for a small party in your home. You can even half the recipe if you want.\nI have made a chocolate sauce\u00a0for the cheesecake . you can skip this if you want. But a sweet chocolate sauce complements the slightly sour taste of the cheesecake very well. You will need cream cheese to make this cheesecake. Also you will need a spring pan or a pan with a detachable base, so that you can easily remove the cheesecake without breaking it.\nHow to make cheesecake\nPreparing the biscuit crust\n1. Take 10 to 12 digestive biscuits or crackers or marie biscuits. Break them and add in a blender or grinder jar.\n2. Grind to a fine powder.\n3. Take this powder in a mixing bowl.\n4. Add 1 tablespoon melted butter in it.\n5. Mix very well with a spoon.\n6. Now place this mixture in greased spring pan. Grease the bottom as well as the sides very well with butter. I used two pans of 5.5 inches (diameter) and 2.75 inches (height). You can also use a 5 or 6 inches round pan. Alternatively, you can even use small to medium baking bowls or ramekins for individual servings. In this case\u00a0you do not need to remove the cheesecake.\n7. With your fingertips or a the back of a small glass or bowl, press the biscuit+butter mixture and make a neat and even layer. Keep this pan in the fridge for 20 to 30 minutes, so that the biscuit layer sets.\nMaking cheese cake\n8. In another bowl, take\u00a03 cups cream cheese (600 grams) and \u00be cup sugar (150 grams). All the ingredients should be at room temperature.\n9. Next add 1 tablespoon corn starch (corn flour), 1 tablespoon lemon juice and\u00a01 teaspoon vanilla extract or powder.\n10. Now with an electric beater, start to whip this mixture.\n11. Use a medium to high speed and whip till smooth and creamy. Scrape the sides with a spatula and continue to beat. You can also use a stand mixer to beat the mixture.\n12. There should be no lumps of cream cheese in the mixture.\n13.\u00a0it should be smooth, thick and creamy without any lumps.\u00a0just beat the mixture till its smooth. Do not over beat.\n14. Now add \u00bd cup cream.\n15. Again beat the mixture.\n16. Whip till the cream is blended very well and you see a homogenous smooth, creamy and thick mixture.\n17. Remove the pan from the fridge. Here is the set biscuit crust layer.\n18. Now pour the whipped cream cheese layer in the pan.\n19. With a spatula even the top.\n20. Keep the pan in a preheated\u00a0oven and bake for 30 to 40 minutes at 180 degrees celsius. Preheat oven at 180 degrees celsius for 15 minutes and keep both the top and bottom heating elements on. Keep the pans in the middle rack. As mentioned before, I used two pans.\n21. After baking, to check the doneness, the sides will look risen, firm and set.\u00a0\u00a0and the centre of the cheesecake will be wobbly, but not runny, when you shake the pan gently. The sides will also look separated from the pan. Let the cheesecake cool at room temperature. On cooling, the centre will become firm. Do not over bake. Since temperatures vary with the size, make and litres of the oven, do keep a check while the cheesecakes are getting baked. Cracks should not form on the cheesecake.\n22. Once the cheesecake has cooled at room temperature, then cover with a foil or an air tight lid. Place the pans in the fridge for 4 hours or more. You can also keep overnight.\nMaking chocolate sauce for cheesecake\n1. Take \u00bd cup hot milk in a bowl. You can heat milk in a pan or a microwave. No need to boil the milk. Just let it get hot.\n2. Add 1 cup roughly chopped sweet chocolate (75 grams). If using semi sweet or bitter chocolate, then do add sugar as per taste.\n3. Mix very well with a spoon or spatula, till all the chocolate dissolves.\n4. Let the chocolate\u00a0sauce\u00a0cool at room temperature.\n5. Dip a butter knife in a bowl or cup containing warm\u00a0water.\n6. Now take the butter knife and gently slid through the sides of the pan, separating the cheesecake from the pan.\n7. Push the detachable lid from the bottom and gently remove the cheesecake. Then gently remove the lid from the base.\n8. Place the cheesecake on a serving plate or tray.\n9. Drizzle the chocolate sauce\u00a0and serve the cheesecake . or your family or guests can serve the chocolate sauce themselves on the sliced cheesecakes. If you want you can even add some berries like blueberries, blackberries or strawberries while serving. Dry fruits can also be\u00a0sprinkled on the cheesecake.\nIf you are looking for more Cake recipes then do check:\nBlack forest cake\nPressure cooker cake\nChoco lava cake\nBiscuit cake\nChocolate cake\nSTEP BY STEP PHOTOS ABOVE Many of my recipes have detailed step by step photos and useful tips to help you make it easily and perfectly.\nPIN\nPRINT\ncheesecake recipe\n4.65 from 14 votes\nCreamy, tasty and soft baked cheesecake.

Doing so may result in cracked tops once the cheese cake gets baked.\nDo keep a check while baking as oven temperatures vary. So it can take less or more time than what is mentioned in the recipe. Do not over bake. If you see cracks on top, then remove it from the oven.\u00a0\nYou can skip making the chocolate sauce but I would suggest to make it.\nGOOD KARMA all our content & photos are copyright protected. a lot of time and effort is spent in researching, developing, testing and photographing recipes. please do not copy. as a blogger, if you you want to adapt this recipe or make a youtube video, then please write the recipe in your own words and give a clickable link back to the recipe on this url.\nTRIED THIS RECIPE ? i would love to hear from you. if you have made this recipe then rate the recipe or leave a comment below. if you like this recipe then do share the recipe link on facebook, twitter & pinterest. for instagram mention @vegrecipesofindia or tag #vegrecipesofindia\nCategories Dessert Recipes , Eggless Cakes\nPost navigation\nTrending Recipes\nhow to make cake without oven | cake recipes without oven\nWhole Wheat Banana Cake (Eggless and Vegan)\ncooker cake | sponge cake in pressure cooker\nBest Punjabi Samosa Recipe\nEasy Pani Puri\n30 Popular Indian Breakfast Recipes for Foodies\n21 ripe banana recipes | easy banana dessert recipes\nEasy No Yeast Pizza Dough (Vegan)\n50 tasty besan recipes (gram flour or chickpea flour recipes)\n91 delicious paneer recipes\n20 popular indian dinner recipes | lunch recipes\noats recipes | 14 oatmeal recipes | easy oats recipes for breakfast or snack\n65 Whole Wheat recipes | Tasty recipes with whole wheat flour (Chapati Atta)\nwheat cake | eggless wheat flour cake\npuri recipe for golgappa or pani puri or puchka\nrava recipes | 35 sooji recipes | sweets and snacks made with semolina\nBhatura Recipe (Bhature without yeast)\nyogurt recipes | curd recipes | 30 indian recipes with yogurt or curd\nmomos recipe | dim sum | veg momos\nTomato Puree (Homemade & Without Preservatives)\n35 Best Indian Rice Recipes\nchivda recipe\nbest gulab jamun \u2013 2 ways\nEggless Chocolate Cake (Whole Wheat)\nSoft Whole Wheat Bread | 100% Wholemeal Bread from Scratch (Eggless)\nPaneer Butter Masala (Restaurant Style)\n20 easy and simple eggless cakes recipes\nGet My Secrets to Great Indian Food\nSign up for my FREE Beginners Guide to Delicious Indian Cooking\nDassana Amit\nnamaste and welcome to vegrecipesofindia.com which i started in feb 2009 and is a pure vegetarian blog. i have been passionate about cooking from childhood and began to cook from the age of 10. later having enrolled in a home science degree greatly enhanced my cooking & baking skills and took it to a different level which i now share as foolproof recipes. i was formally trained both in mainstream indian as well as international cuisines.\nAbout Dassana Amit\nComments are closed.\n44 comments/reviews\nsaswati datta\nAug 15, 2019\nLove your recipes\ndassana amit\nAug 15, 2019\nthank you very much ????\nElza\nJul 17, 2019\nHi Dasanna, can the Amul cream be used for the cream you mentioned, not instead of cream cheese.\ndassana amit\nJul 17, 2019\nhi elza, you can use amul cream.\nMaha\nJun 20, 2019\nHi!!

Have couple of queries, if you could answer: 1. How do I adapt this recipe for making a baked mango cheesecake? 2. Cream mentioned in the reipe is Fresh cream (Malai) or cream from tetra pack? 3. Instead of creamcheese, can I use a blended mixture of Chenna (crumpled paneer) and Malai (Fresh cream)?\ndassana amit\nMay 11, 2017\nthanks khushboo. your queries answered below:\n1. use 2 cups cream cheese and 1 cup of mango puree. sugar you can reduce to 1/3rd or 1/2 cup. 2. its cream from the tetra pack. 3. you can definitely use chenna and malai. the method would be whip or blend the chenna till it becomes smooth. mango the mango puree with the sugar. add this mango puree to the chenna. mix well or use the beater to mix well. whip cream separately and then add and again mix. or you can add cream directly and then beat again till everything is mixed.\nPriyanka Chauhan\nJan 15, 2017\nHi dear..

khara...\nkhara bun recipe | masala bun iyengar bakery | iyengar bakery khara bun\nBy\nHebbars Kitchen\n-\nApril 14, 2020\nkhara bun recipe | masala bun iyengar bakery | iyengar bakery khara bun with detailed photo and video recipe. an easy and popular south indian version of pav bun recipe made with plain flour, spices and onions. the recipe was mainly made and served in the south indian iyengar bakery\u2019s but is widely known across india. it is generally served as an evening snack with a cup of tea or coffee but can also be served for morning breakfast.\nkhara bun recipe | masala bun iyengar bakery | iyengar bakery khara bun with step by step photo and video recipe. bun or pav recipe are extremely popular recipe across india and are known for its various types. in north and western india it is known as pav but in south it is referred to as bun. one such bun recipe is masala bun or khara bun, from the popular iyengar bakery chain known for its extra flavour and spices in each bite.\niyengar bakery\u2019s in south india are known for its unique snacks, desserts or cake recipes. even though the iyengar community hails from tamilnadu, but these bakery chains are extremely popular in bangalore and hyderabad. they are known for their fusion recipes or to experiment with the traditional recipes. i have already shared the other popular honey cake recipe from the iyengar franchise. now with this post, i am attempting to recreate the other popular spicy pav or masala bun. the best part of this snack is spice and savoury taste within the bun. the traditional pav or bun does require an additional side dish or curry recipe with it, but this bun is self-sufficient as herbs, spices and even finely chopped onion is added.\nfurthermore, i would like to add a few more tips, suggestions and variations to khara bun recipe . firstly, the recipe is generally made with plain flour or maida atta for the extra softness. you may attempt the same recipe with wheat flour to avoid the maida , but you may not get the same texture. secondly, i have used the baking oven to bake these pav or bun recipe to get the bigger size bun. you may attempt the same recipe in a pressure cooker if you do not have access to a traditional oven. you may refer my previous post of ladi pav in a pressure cooker for more details. lastly, there isn\u2019t any additional preservatives added to this recipe and hence the shelf life is 1-2 days. hence you may need to plan it accordingly.\nfinally, i request you to check my other detailed bakery recipes collection with this post of khara bun recipe . it mainly includes recipes like nankhatai , pav , chegodilu , chocolate cookies , pineapple upside-down cake , dry fruit chikki , suji snacks , chocolate banana cake , mullu murukku , banana chips . further to these i would also like to mention my other recipes categories like,\nstreet food recipes\nsandwich recipes\nsnacks recipes\nkhara bun video recipe:\nstreet food recipes

Hence it also becomes difficult to believe that these are made with whole wheat flour. With this recipe you can make one of the best pancakes with whole wheat flour and without eggs.\nFor the recipe I have used organic chakki ground atta (whole wheat flour). You can use any brand of whole wheat flour. If the wheat flour is ground in a mill, then do sieve the flour once or twice before using.\nThese pancakes are lightly sweet and not very sweet or sweet . for sweet pancakes you can always add more sugar. You can even skip adding sugar for a sugar free pancake. For a healthier variation add jaggery or coconut sugar or palm jaggery. The recipe serves 6 pancakes and can be easily halved or doubled or tripled.\nServe eggless pancakes with maple syrup and a side of fruits. If using honey, then pour honey on the pancakes when they become warm. You can even use dates syrup or jaggery syrup. Chocolate lovers can use chocolate syrup to serve with these fluffy whole wheat pancakes.\nHow to make whole wheat pancakes without eggs\nMixing dry ingredients\n1. In a mixing bowl first take\u00a01 cup whole wheat flour.\u00a0if the wheat flour is ground in a mill, then do sieve the flour once or twice before using.\n2. Add\u00a01 pinch salt. Skip adding salt if using salted butter.\n3. Add\u00a03 teaspoons sugar. You can even add 1 to 2 teaspoons sugar or skip it entirely.\n4. Add\u00a01 teaspoon baking powder.\n5. Add \u00bc teaspoon cinnamon powder. You can even add \u00bc teaspoon vanilla essence or \u00bd teaspoon vanilla extract.\n6. With a wired whisk mix all the dry ingredients very well. Keep aside.\nMixing wet ingredients for making eggless pancakes\n7. Take\u00a01.5 cups milk in a sauce pan. Keep the pan on a low to medium-low flame and begin to heat milk. You can also use almond milk or soy milk.\n8. When the milk is becoming hot do stir occasionally. Do not boil the milk but let it just become hot. You should see some steam coming from the milk.\n9. When the milk becomes hot, add 1\u00a0tablespoon unsalted butter. You can also use oil instead of butter. Use a neutral flavored oil.\n10. Mix the butter in the hot milk very well.\nMaking egg free pancake batter\n11. Then add this mixture to the dry ingredients in the bowl.\n12. With a wired whisk mix very well.\n13. Break lumps with a whisk and make a smooth batter. A few tiny lumps are fine in the batter. The pancake batter is of a pourable consistency and not thick. If the batter looks thick, then you can add \u00bc to \u2153 cup more of hot milk. Depending on quality of whole wheat flour more milk can be added.\n14. Keep the pancake batter aside.\nMaking eggless pancakes\n15. Then heat a heavy tawa/griddle or pan.\u00a0spread \u00bd to 1 teaspoon unsalted butter or oil on the tawa.\n16. With a ladle gently pour the batter. Do not spread the batter with the ladle. The batter spreads on its own. You can even use a \u00bc to \u2153 measuring cup to pour the pancake batter.\n18. On a medium-low flame cook the pancake.\n19. Cook the pancake till you see bubbles forming on the surface.\n20. When the base becomes crisp and golden, gently turn over pancake.\n21.

My heartfelt thanks. I am planning to prepare this for my toddler who is 2 yrs old. Can i refrigerate the pancakes ? if so, how long would it stay good. Thought i ll make it over weekends and send it for my kid\u2019s school as snacks..Is that possible?\ndassana amit\nAug 27, 2019\nhi gayathri, firstly thank you. yes, you can refrigerate them but both the taste and texture will change. cooked food undergoes some chemical changes when they are kept for a few more days at room temperature or in the fridge. pancakes are always best to be had hot or warm straight from the pan. if making for tiffin, then it is better to make them fresh and pack. making pancakes do not take a lot of time. you can make a dry pancake mix with the dry ingredients. just double or triple the recipe. store in an air-tight jar. then mix the liquids with the pancake mix and fry pancakes. hope this helps.\nMani\nJul 05, 2019\nI made it as per your recipe but it dint turn out well.pancakes were liquidy from inside and felt kaccha also the bubbles dint form nor the flour risen as pancakes should.What could be the mistake?\ndassana amit\nJul 06, 2019\nit due to baking powder not being fresh or active. bubbles are seen when the pancake is made. this happens due to the reaction of the baking powder in the batter. if bubbles are not seen, then it simply implies that the baking powder is not fresh and active. this is also the reason for the pancakes not rising. the pancakes will look raw but they are not raw, just that they do not look cooked well. since baking powder is the only leavening ingredient used in the recipe, it should be active and under its shelf life.\nUmika\nJul 02, 2019\nHello Dassana,\nThis is my first comment on your website but I have been cooking your receipes for a long time now. I love the way you explain the whole process with pictures and clear words. Needless to say, I am a huge fan.\nI have a doubt with this receipe. Can we replace milk with Buttermilk (unsalted) ?\ndassana amit\nJul 03, 2019\nthank you umika. i am glad the clarity in words of the recipe method is helpful. of course, you can use buttermilk. buttermilk pancakes are also popular, though i have not added the recipe. but even for this pancake recipe, buttermilk will work. in case of buttermilk, you can just use it cold or at room temperature. no need to warm or heat the buttermilk. butter can be melted first and then added along with the buttermilk.\nKrishna Singh\nJun 12, 2019\nHello mam, I really love reading the recipies shared by you as they are very down to earth, all ingredients available in kitchen, easy to cook, and great in taste. Explained in simple way, with illustrations. Thanks again mam. Is there any book with collection of all your recipes ?\ndassana amit\nJun 19, 2019\nthank you krishna. right now there is no book. i wanted to work on a book this year, but due to lack of time, not able too. i hope i plan to get the book as soon as possible.\nDevota Rubama\nJun 06, 2019\nThis recipe is good.

Since last couple of months, your recipes are my \u201cto go\u201d and especially the cakes and cookies. You know why.. as I am a vegetarian and health freak. Your eggless recipes and whole-wheat recipes are perfect combo for me ????thanks! Look forward for more amazing recipes!\ndassana amit\nOct 31, 2018\nthanks a lot yasha both for the feedback on the pancake recipes as well as the review. glad you are liking the cakes and cookies recipes. i do plan to add some more.\nBhavya Sehgal\nOct 24, 2018\nHi Dassana I tried the pancake recipe 2 days back for the first time. Was a little apprehensive before serving it to my parents (esp my dad who is also a huge critic of my cooking) as they don\u2019t relish non-indian recipes but to my surprise THEY BOTH ENJOYED THE PANCAKES IMMENSELY & those are now included in our breakfast menu ????\nJust one query : how do I make the pancakes more fluffy?? I used chakki atta that which has lot of chokar in it & I didn\u2019t seive it.\ndassana amit\nOct 24, 2018\nthats so nice to know. i feel good when i read comments like yours. thank you bhavya for sharing this. the chokhar can give a gritty taste in the pancake. so do sieve the atta twice or thrice. if the batter looks thick, then you can add some more water. a smooth textured flour will yield fluffy pancakes. a coarsely ground flour may not. hope this helps.\nDr. Bhavya Sehgal\nOct 29, 2018\nThanxx a lot for replying. Will make the suggested changes the next time i make it \ud83d\ude42\nAnkur Swami\nOct 14, 2018\nAll went wrong.. I am very excited to try it but it turns into disaster. Do u have any secret ingredient for it\u2026coz I follow all steps but didn\u2019t work out.\ndassana amit\nOct 14, 2018\ncan you let me know what happened. was the batter thick or thin? or were the pancakes sticking to the pan. i can then only tell what must have gone wrong.\nSM\nFeb 17, 2018\nHi Dassana, This recipe was awesome!! Guilt free indulgence of pancakes!! Lots of \u2764\ufe0f SM\ndassana amit\nFeb 18, 2018\nSM, Glad to know that you liked this pancake recipe.\ndilna\nJan 08, 2018\nHi , can I use baking soda instead ?\ndassana amit\nJan 09, 2018\ndilna, you can add \u00bc or \u2153 teaspoon baking soda. but do note that baking soda will give some of its aroma in the pancake.\nMeera\nJan 04, 2018\nHi\u2026. can I prepare this batter and store it for a few days \u2026\u2026 say one or two days \u2026.in the fridge?!!\ndassana amit\nJan 04, 2018\nmeera, if stored and refrigerated the leavening action that has happened because of the baking powder, will decrease. so the pancakes won\u2019t be fluffy. instead you can make the dry mix with the flour etc and store in bulk.\nRia Samuel\nJan 04, 2018\nI loved these pancakes especially the pores \u2013 looks like set dosas.. I haven\u2019t been able to get the wheat flour pancakes these fluffy. Definitely going to give this a shot.\ndassana amit\nJan 04, 2018\nThanks Ria.

served as breakfast or snack . these have a crispy, flaky texture and taste too good. This scallion pancakes recipe is shared with step by step pics.\nWhen you have scallion or spring onions left over after making a Chinese dish, you can consider making these crispy tasty pancakes and I bet you won\u2019t regret.\nGet My Secrets to Great Indian Food\nSign up for my FREE Beginners Guide to Delicious Indian Cooking\nSome years back, I came to know about the existence of these super tasty pancakes from the mainland china cookbook. From there on I started making these pancakes adapting with the ingredients available locally. This recipe makes up for 8 scallion pancakes.\nWhat are scallion pancakes\nScallion pancakes are an unleavened flatbread stuffed with scallions or green onions or spring onions . hence these pancakes are also called as green onion pancakes or spring onion pancakes. Scallion pancakes are a popular street food in china and are known as Cong you bing in Chinese.\nThese Chinese pancakes have a flaky, crispy outer layer with a softness inside the layers . these are truly addictive and make up for a great snack or breakfast. Although these are flatbreads and similar to an Indian Spring onion paratha , yet they are called as pancakes.\nThis scallion pancake is slightly different from the Chinese version as\n\u2713 made with whole wheat flour instead of all purpose flour \u2713 is vegan \u2713 an adaptable and forgiving recipe \u2713 easy to make \u2713 stuffed & rolled pancakes can be frozen. (thaw before frying) \u2713 the recipe can be easily doubled or tripled.\nTips on ingredients for scallion pancakes\n1. Whole wheat flour \u2013 since whole wheat flour is used in the recipe, the amount of water will depend on the quality of flour. So add water in parts while kneading. You should get a soft dough much like a chapati or paratha or naan dough. Instead of whole wheat flour, you can even use all purpose flour.\n2. Water \u2013 in the recipe hot water is added when mixing and kneading the dough. As a result, the pancakes have a soft texture from inside and the heaviness or denseness of whole wheat flour is not felt in the layers.\n3. Roasted sesame oil \u2013 adding roasted sesame oil gives a strong smoky aroma in the pancakes. Now if you do not get roasted sesame oil, there is no need to panic. A sunflower oil or peanut oil works well but the smoky flavor won\u2019t be there. Even butter or ghee or any neutral flavored oil can be added.\n4. Scallions or green onions or spring onions \u2013 traditionally the white part of the onions is skipped. I prefer adding them along with the greens. If using then onion whites then chop them very finely or else the pancakes will break while rolling. Also to remember is that if you are using the scallion whites, then use the greens more than the whites.\n5. Spices \u2013 some green chillies can be added for a bit of heat and spice. You can even add sichuan pepper powder or Chinese 5 spice powder or crushed black pepper. For that matter, even our own Indian garam masala can be added to get a fusion recipe.\nTips on frying scallion pancakes\n1. Frying pan \u2013 it is best to use a cast iron pan or a thick bottomed pan for frying as this gives a crisp crust in the pancakes. Using a small shallow frying pan helps in giving crisp edges and a crisp crust in the pancake as the oil does not spread out over a large surface area.\n2. Frying oil \u2013 while sesame oil is used in the stuffing, vegetable oil or a neutral tasting oil is used for frying. I have here used sunflower oil for frying. You can even use peanut oil, butter or ghee for frying.\n3. Oil quantity \u2013 1 tablespoon oil is used for frying each pancake. 1 tablespoon oil (approx 15 ml) looks like a lot of oil but makes the pancakes crispy. You can use less oil if you prefer. If you feel the oil is more in the pancakes, then reduce it to \u00bd tablespoon or even less per pancake.\nHow to make scallion pancakes\nMaking dough\n1. In a mixing bowl take 2 heaped cups whole wheat flour (250 grams) and \u00bd teaspoon salt. Note that the dough can be mixed and kneaded even in a stand mixer.\n2. With a spoon mix the salt with the flour.\n3. In a saucepan take 1.25 cups water and keep the pan on a medium to medium-high flame for the water to boil.\n4. Let the water come to a boil.\n5. Now add the boiling hot water in the flour+salt mixture in parts. First, add \u00bd cup of water.\n6. Mix with a spoon. Then if required add more hot water till the mixture starts to leave the sides of the bowl and comes together. I added 1 cup water to get a soft smooth dough. So go easy while adding water as the Water absorption will depend on quality and texture of flour . if using only All-purpose flour , then you may just need to add \u2153 to \u00bd cup boiling hot water.\n7. Let the heat from the mixture become easier to handle and then begin to knead the dough.\n8. Knead to a soft dough and keep aside. If the dough is sticky then add more flour. If the dough is dry and hard, then add more of the hot water which would have become warm by the time you start to knead the dough. Mix and knead till all the water is absorbed and dough becomes soft. Cover and keep aside.\n9. Rinse the scallion or spring onion stalks in water first. Then finely chop the spring onion greens. You can add a bit of the whites too, but finely chop them or else they break the dough while rolling. Add more greens and less of the whites. You will need \u2154 to \u00be cup finely chopped scallions.\nMaking the stuffed dough rolls for green onion pancake\n10. Take the entire dough and roll it into a log shape of 10 to 11 inches.\n11. Slice the log in 7 to 8 equal parts. Keep the sliced dough circles covered in the same bowl in which the dough was kneaded.\n12. Take each part and roll it to a round shape first between your palms. Place it on a rolling board and flatten slightly. Sprinkle some flour on the board as well as on the flattened dough.\n13. Roll to a large 8 by 10 inches rectangle. Do not roll the dough too thin.\n14. Spread or brush toasted sesame oil all over the dough.\n15. Sprinkle the finely chopped spring onion all over except the edges. Also sprinkle a light pinch of salt all over the scallions. Adding salt can be skipped. At this step, you can also add black pepper, finely chopped green chillies for some spicy taste if you prefer. A pinch of sichuan pepper powder or Chinese 5 spice powder can also be sprinkled. For an Indian flavor, you can add a pinch of garam masala.\n16. From any side of the rectangle, gently roll the stuffed dough. While rolling, tighten and then roll. Do not keep the roll loose. It should be a tight roll.\n17. Pinch and close the edges.\n18. Now hold one of the edges and begin to roll the stuffed dough around it to make a spiral roll. Press and seal the last edge at the sides or beneath the roll. This way make all spiral rolls and keep them covered.\n19. Take one roll and sprinkle some flour on it as well as on the rolling board. Press lightly with your fingers.\n20. Roll to a slightly thick bread having a 5 to 6 inches diameter.\nFrying scallion pancakes\n21. Heat a skillet or pan \u2013 preferable a cast iron skillet or pan. Add 1 tablespoon oil and let it become hot. When the oil becomes hot, gently place the pancake in the oil. You can use peanut oil or sunflower oil or any neutral flavored oil or butter or ghee (clarified butter) for frying. I have used sunflower oil.\n22. When one side is cooked and golden, flip over. Cook the second side. Fry on medium flame.\n23. When the second side is fried and you see the crispy crusty golden spots then flip over again.\n24. Fry both sides till you golden. You can fry a couple of times if the pancakes look undercooked. The cast iron pan that I have gets too hot, so I would increase the flame to medium initially and later while frying the pancakes, reduce the flame to medium-low. Use a small shallow frying pan as the oil does not spread out over a large surface area and helps in giving crisp edges and a crisp crust in the pancake. You can fry for some more time to get a more crispy and crusty layer.\n25. Place the fried green onion pancake on kitchen paper towels. Fry all the scallion pancakes this way. For frying the next pancake, add \u00bd to 1 tablespoon oil in the pan.\n26. Then Serve scallion pancakes hot with your favorite dipping sauce. You can also stack them up in a casserole and serve once you are done frying all the pancakes. While serving you can squish the pancakes between your palms so that the layers are visible. Take care of the heat while squishing them. You can even slice or cut them in wedges and serve.\nServing suggestion for scallion pancakes\nSpicy dipping sauce \u2013 scallion pancakes can be served with any spicy dipping sauce. We like it with sriracha sauce and schezwan sauce. In fact you can even use red chilli garlic sauce, green chilli sauce or even tomato ketchup.\nVegetarian stir fry or sauce based Chinese recipe \u2013 you can also have green onion pancakes as a side with any of the Chinese recipes like veg manchurian gravy, paneer manchurian etc.\nIndian flavors \u2013 for Indian taste buds, mango pickle or lemon pickle or green chilli pickle make a good accompaniment for spring onion pancakes.\nFew more tasty recipes for you!\nAloo paratha\nEggless waffles\nMethi paratha\nBanana pancake\nEggless pancake\nSTEP BY STEP PHOTOS ABOVE Many of my recipes have detailed step by step photos and useful tips to help you make it easily and perfectly.\nPIN\nPRINT\nScallion Pancakes\n5 from 2 votes\nScallion pancakes is a Chinese street food and breakfast snack of flatbread stuffed with scallions or green onions or spring onions.

One of the easiest recipe to make is a pasta recipe. Pasta alfredo is a creamy pasta made with mixed veggies. The creaminess comes from the addition of fresh cream.\nFettuccine alfredo was originally invented by alfredo di lelio in his mother\u2019s restaurant in italy. The original and authentic recipe is made with plenty of butter and parmesan cheese. Thus the pasta is very rich. Moreover, fettuccine pasta gets a creamy and smooth coating of melted butter and cheese on them \u2013 source Wikipedia\nThe authentic alfredo sauce does not use cream but only butter and cheese . Though there are some variations made with eggs and cream. What we get served in the Italian restaurants in India as alfredo pasta is usually made with cream.\nIn fact, I have been making from 10 years a pasta recipe with mushrooms, veggies and low fat cream. Back then I did know it was a variation of alfredo pasta. I just made it on a whim once and it was so good, that I made it again many times. Since I used to add more cream, I never shared the recipe thinking thats its rich and heavy and may not suit some readers.\nTips for making alfredo pasta\nIn this recipe of alfredo pasta also, the cream is added, \u00a0but the quantity is less and low fat cream is used. Avoid using heavy whipping cream. Instead you can use half and half or light cream.\nIn this recipe I have used a mix of red bell pepper, carrots and potatoes. You can add any veggies of your choice. you can even steam or grill them and then add. I am sharing an easy method where I have cooked the veggies in a pan and then added the cooked pasta to them.\nFor the pasta, you can use a variety of pasta like fettuccine, pappardelle, macaroni, shell macaroni, rigatoni and farfalle.\nWhile serving alfredo sauce pasta, garnish it with some dried or fresh parsley and some grated parmesan cheese.\nHow to make alfredo pasta\nA) cooking pasta:\n1.

Tasty grilled sandwiches made with a spiced rajma stuffing. Rajma beans are kidney beans.\nSharing a simple and tasty rajma sandwich that is liked by everyone . usually when I cook rajma or chana, I cook\u00a0some\u00a0extra, so that I can make sandwiches from them. For this recipe, I have shown the complete method of soaking and cooking rajma. If you have leftover Rajma recipe \u00a0or chana masala, then you can even make sandwiches with them. The consistency of the rajma masala or chana masala has to be dry or semi-dry to make sandwiches.\nGet My Secrets to Great Indian Food\nSign up for my FREE Beginners Guide to Delicious Indian Cooking\nBoth rajma sandwiches and Chana sandwiches are heavy and filling. They keep you full for some time.\nFor some crunch in the sandwiches , I have added capsicum (bell pepper). You can even add grated carrots or beetroots. Even a mix of some onions, tomatoes and capsicum can be added. Veggies can be skipped too. I have also added grated cheese, which can be given a skip.\nThis rajma sandwich can be toasted too . you can toast the sandwiches in a sandwich maker, oven or a tawa (pan). If using tawa, you can check this recipe on preparing a grilled sandwich on tawa \u2013 How to make grilled sandwich on tawa .\nServe grilled rajma sandwiches with tomato ketchup or chilli sauce.\nHow to make rajma sandwich\nPressure cooking rajma\n1. Rinse \u00bd cup rajma or red kidney beans (125 grams) first a couple of times. Then soak in enough water for 7 to 8 hours or overnight. Next day drain all the soaked water and rinse the rajma beans very well in fresh water.\n2.add them in a pressure cooker along with 1.5 cups water.\n3.\u00a0pressure cook rajma on a medium flame for 12 to 13 minutes or till the rajma beans are cooked well.\n4.\u00a0there should not be any bite in the beans. Depending on the quality of beans, they may take less or more time to cook. Drain the water and keep aside.\nPreparing rajma Stuffing\n5. Heat 1 tablespoon butter or oil in a pan or kadai.\n6. Add \u00bd teaspoon cumin seeds and saute till the cumin seeds splutter.\n7. Then add\u00a0\u2153 cup chopped onions.\n8. Saute till the onions turn light brown.\n9. Then add 1 teaspoon ginger-garlic paste.\n10. Saute till the raw aroma of both ginger and garlic goes away.\n11. Keep the flame to a low and then add \u00bc teaspoon turmeric powder, \u00bd teaspoon Kashmiri red chili powder, \u00bd teaspoon coriander powder and\u00a01 teaspoon pav bhaji masala [add \u00bd teaspoon garam masala + \u00bc teaspoon amchur powder (dry mango powder) if you do not have pav bhaji masala].\n12.

If you want you can add some more amchur powder.\nAssembling and grilling rajma sandwiches\n18. Spread butter on bread slices. I have used Whole wheat bread as a healthier alternative. You can also use Brown , multi grain or White bread . you can skip spreading butter if you want. Add the rajma stuffing on the bread slices.\n19. Top up with some chopped capsicum. You can also add onion slices, tomato slices, grated carrots or beetroot.\n20. Add some grated cheddar cheese. You can also add grated paneer instead of cheese.\n21.

Keep the flame to the lowest and then pour 1 cup chilled milk in a gentle stream. Pour the milk with one hand and stir the sauce mixture with the other. The milk has to be chilled, so that lumps are not formed. If you use hot or warm milk or milk at room temperature, lumps can be formed.\n5. Do stir frequently while the milk warms and heats up.\n6. On a low flame, simmer the sauce till it thickens.\n7. When the sauce has thickened well and coats the back of a spoon, switch off the flame.\n8. Keep the saucepan down and add the seasonings \u2013 \u00bc teaspoon black pepper powder, a generous pinch of nutmeg powder or grated nutmeg and salt as required. For a cheese sauce, you can add 2 tablespoons of grated cheddar cheese.\n9. Mix very well and keep aside.\u00a0do note that on cooling white sauce will thicken more.

chikki recipe | kaju badam chikki | mixed nuts chikki\nBy\nHebbars Kitchen\n-\nFebruary 21, 2020\ndry fruit chikki recipe | kaju badam chikki | mixed nuts chikki with detailed photo and video recipe. a popular and tasty dry fruit-based indian fudge made with cashews, almonds and pistachios. the traditional chikki recipe made just with peanuts and jaggery syrup, whereas this recipe is an extension to it with choice of mixed nuts. it is generally made as a sweet snack to be consumed with a cup of tea, but can also be served as dessert after or during the meal.\ndry fruit chikki recipe | kaju badam chikki | mixed nuts chikki with step by step photo and video recipe. chikki recipes are popular nut-based sweet snack from the popular south indian or western indian cuisine. the most famous or the traditional one is to make with groundnuts in a jaggery syrup, but lately, there have been many variations to it and has onboarded many other nuts. one such popular variation is dry fruit chikki recipe, made with a myriad choice of dry fruits.\ni am a huge fan of traditional chikki recipes which is made just with peanuts and jaggery. i personally do not like the other variations like sesame. sunflower seeds or any other seeds based chikki. having said that i have a lot of respect for this premium mixed nuts chikki . the main reason being the use of mixed premium nuts in it. as a matter of fact, i make this often and consume it as a protein bar or energy bar and not as a chikki. the commercially available energy bars are no different than this recipe. perhaps they may have more choice of the nut with chocolate or coconut flavour in it to make it more attractive. nevertheless, kaju badam chikki is still a wonderful snack and can be served for myriad occasions.\nfurthermore, before wrapping up the recipe, some tips, suggestions and variations for dry fruit chikki recipe . firstly, i would heavily recommend you to have equal proportions of nuts for this recipe. yet to make it thrifty and economical, you can reduce the quantity of premium nuts and add peanuts. secondly, do not forget to add clarified butter or ghee while cooking jaggery syrup. it helps to have the glossy look and also makes it less brittle. lastly, these chikki easily last long for 2-3 weeks when stored in an airtight container . also while shaping and cutting the chikki, make sure to have small square-shaped chikkis.\nfinally, i request you to check my other detailed indian sweets recipes collection with this post of dry fruit chikki recipe . it mainly includes recipe like, gulgula , besan ladoo , horlicks mysore pak , kobbari laddu , badam ladoo , narali bhat , mathura peda , ashoka halwa , mtr gulab jamun , 7 cup barfi . further to these i would also like to mention my other recipe
