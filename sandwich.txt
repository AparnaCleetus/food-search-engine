recipe. a popular indian street food sandwich made with layers of bread slices with vegetable and spice stuffing. there is a myriad version to this layered sandwich recipe which includes both meat and vegetable stuffing. in india, it is generally served as street food snack, but can also be served as morning breakfast or also for lunch and dinner.\nclub sandwich recipe | how to make indian style veg club sandwich with step by step photo and video recipe. sandwich recipe being a non-native recipe to indian cuisine, but has been widely accepted. it has mainly entered into the street food cuisine, with chaat ingredients like green chutney and tamarind sauce . one such adapted sandwich recipe is veg club sandwich recipe known for its burst of flavour and filling taste.\nas i mentioned earlier, this recipe of club sandwich is inherited to indian cuisine from western cuisine. typically this kind of sandwich is made with meat slices with vegetable slices like tomato, onions and cucumber. it may also contain a thin slice of cheese in it which makes it filling, but has a bland taste to it. however, the same recipe has been adapted and changed as per the indian taste. in india, it has the same set of ingredients but has extra spice in it. it is topped with spice condiments like green chutney and spice tomato sauce . in addition to it, i have also added a paneer masala mixture as its base, which not only makes it filling but also a tasty sandwich recipe.\nfurthermore, i would also like to highlight some tips, suggestions and variations to club sandwich recipe . firstly, i would heavily recommend to use sandwich bread slices for this recipe and avoid other types of bread. particularly avoid bread types like wheat bread, sourdough bread, mixed grain bread. secondly, adding vegetable slices to it is completely open-ended. you may experiment with boiled potato slices, tomato, onion, cucumber, beetroot and carrot slices. lastly, these sandwich are generally made in 3 plus layers with each layer with different stuffing. in this post, i have used 3 bread slices to make 2 layers, but can be easily further extended.\nfinally, i request you to check my other sandwich recipes collection with this post of club sandwich recipe . it mainly includes my other variations like veggie burger , mayonnaise cheese sandwich , aloo toast , chocolate sandwich ,

Drain all the water and add the rinsed leaves in a small grinder jar. Add \u00bd tsp chaat masala powder and salt as required. Grind the chutney ingredients till smooth. No need to add water while grinding as there is enough moisture after rinsing the coriander leaves which helps them to grind to a smooth chutney. If you are unable to grind, then add 1 or 2 teaspoons of water. Remove sandwich chutney and keep aside. A few drops of lemon juice can also be added.\nI have divided the entire post into following parts:\nMaking paneer sandwich Indian style \u2013 recipe 1\nMaking vegetable paneer sandwich \u2013 recipe 2\nUse this link to Jump to recipe\nThis first recipe\nShared is an\nIndian style paneer sandwich which includes green chutney, spices and herbs. You can alter the amount of spices and herbs as per your taste buds.\nHow to make paneer sandwich (Indian style) \u2013 recipe 1\n1. Crumble 200 grams paneer in a bowl or pan. Do not crumble finely. Some small chunks of paneer is fine. You can even chop paneer in small cubes instead of crumbling.\n2. Add the following spice powders \u2013 1 pinch of turmeric powder, \u00bc teaspoon cumin powder, \u00bd teaspoon Kashmiri red chilli powder, \u00bd teaspoon coriander powder (ground coriander), \u00bd teaspoon garam masala powder, \u00bd teaspoon dry mango powder (amchur powder).\n3. Add 2 tablespoon fresh curd (yogurt). Also season with salt as per taste.\n4. Mix very well.\n5. Take the bread slices and spread some butter on them. I have used whole wheat bread. You can use any bread of your choice like brown bread, white bread, multigrain bread or whole wheat sandwich bread.\n6. Spread sandwich chutney on the slices. Recipe of sandwich chutney is mentioned in recipe card below. Addition of sandwich chutney is optional and you can skip it also. Or you can use any green chutney you have like mint chutney or coriander chutney or mint coriander chutney.\n7. Now place some thin onion slices and sliced bell pepper. I have used red bell pepper (red capsicum or shimla mirch), you can use green or yellow bell pepper or skip them altogether.\n8. Sprinkle some chaat masala on top.\n9. Add the paneer stuffing.\n10. Cover with the remaining bread slices on which both butter and sandwich chutney has already been spread.\n11. Place the paneer sandwiches in a preheated sandwich maker.\n12. Grill till crisp and golden.\nRemove and\u00a0 Serve grilled paneer\u00a0sandwich hot or warm with any dip or sauce of your choice. You can serve it with tomato ketchup or pudina chutney or coriander chutney or any chutney or dip of your choice.\nTips for making paneer sandwich\nI have used whole wheat bread to make these sandwiches. You can use any bread of your choice like brown bread, white bread, multigrain bread or whole wheat sandwich bread.\nThese sandwiches taste best with fresh paneer. If you use frozen paneer, then the stuffing feels a bit dry. If you buy paneer from a halwai or from a store, then make sure the paneer is moist and fresh. Or else you can make paneer at home.\nTo make a vegan version of paneer sandwich, replace paneer with tofu and butter with olive oil. Also don\u2019t forget to use vegan curd.\nGreen chutney can be skipped. You can be creative by adding vegan or vegetarian mayonnaise or hung curd or cream cheese as a spread.\nVegetable paneer sandwich \u2013 recipe 2\nThis veg\u00a0paneer sandwich which I make sometimes, \u00a0 Is a variation of the Bombay veg sandwich. Along with the paneer, vegetables & the green chutney, the sandwich becomes a healthy one.\nIf you don\u2019t have the veggies , then you can still make the sandwich with the paneer stuffing. In this recipe I made a fusion of Italian and Indian flavors. The paneer has Italian-Indian herbs in it, whilst the veggies is spiced with Indian spices. For the paneer stuffing, I have used basil leaves, celery and coriander. You can make good fusion sandwiches by combining different flavors. To make a vegan version of paneer sandwich, replace paneer with tofu and butter with olive oil.\nHere I have used homemade whole wheat bread. You can use any bread like\u00a0brown bread\u00a0or white bread to make this sandwich.\nI served the \u00a0 Veg \u00a0 Paneer sandwich with coriander chutney and tomato sauce. However, the sandwich can also be served with basil pesto.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor sandwiches 8 to 10 slices of whole wheat bread or brown bread or white bread 1 medium size tomato 1 beetroot \u2013 boiled and peeled 1 potato \u2013 boiled and peeled 1 medium size onion \u2013 peeled Chaat masala as required Cumin powder as required Butter or olive oil as required\nFor paneer stuffing 200 grams paneer (cottage cheese) 4 to 5 Italian basil leaves 1 teaspoon chopped celery 1 tablespoon chopped coriander leaves (cilantro leaves) \u00bd teaspoon dry oregano \u00bc teaspoon black pepper powder \u00bc teaspoon red chili powder or red chili flakes 1 green chili \u2013 chopped Rock salt or black salt as required\nHow to make veg paneer sandwich \u2013 recipe 2\n1. Crumble the paneer with your hands or grate it. Add the chopped basil, celery, coriander leaves, green chillies along with black pepper, red chilli powder and salt. Mix well.\n2. Spread or brush some butter or olive oil on the bread. Add a tbsp or more of the paneer mixture on the bread. Sprinkle some chaat masala and cumin powder. Place two or three slices each of boiled potato, onion, boiled beetroot and tomato. Sprinkle some salt, chaat masala and cumin powder again.\n3. Place the second buttered or oiled bread on top and either grill or toast the sandwich. Here I have used my old sandwich hand toaster which works on stovetop.\n4. Once the sandwiches are browned, then remove and spread some butter if required on the sandwiches.\u00a0 Serve veg paneer sandwich\u00a0hot with mint chutney and tomato sauce.\nMore\nSandwich recipes\nClub sandwich\nCheese sandwich\nMayonnaise sandwich\nGrilled sandwich\nThis paneer sandwich recipe is from the archives and was originally published on 29 jan 2017.

I was wondering because I have always applied butter on the outer side also thinking that this will give the golden look to the sandwich..\ndassana amit\nAug 03, 2017\nruchi, i have not applied butter outside. i guess i spread too much butter on the inside of the bread. so when grilling the butter has come out on the top side through the bread and made it crisp. but many times i do not apply butter for most sandwiches on outside and they turn out crisp.\nNanditha\nMar 22, 2017\nHi ,\nThank you for all your efforts.

Most sandwiches are easy and quick enough to prepare . also there are many variations one can do in the stuffing. This recipe of curd sandwich can also be called as raita sandwich. For hungry kids or even adults, these make a quick snack or brunch option. Since curd is added, I would not recommend to pack these sandwiches in tiffin box.\nGet My Secrets to Great Indian Food\nSign up for my FREE Beginners Guide to Delicious Indian Cooking\nTips for making curd sandwich\nWe usually prefer to grill curd sandwiches, but you can also just have them plain or toast the bread separately and then place the curd filling in it.\nDo use thick curd, hung yogurt or greek yogurt to make the filling.\nFor the sandwich stuffing, I have used a mix of cabbage, carrots and capsicum.\nI have also added steamed corn kernels. Instead of corn kernels you can also add steamed or boiled green peas or boiled potatoes. Do note that all the veggies are raw except the steamed corn kernels . if you want you can even blanch the cabbage leaves and then add. Lettuce leaves can also be added.\nFor the seasoning, I have used mixed herbs . the recipe is more international style and not spicy. You can Indianize the recipe by adding Indian herbs & spices like coriander leaves, mint leaves, green chilies, chaat masala, garam masala powder and red chilli powder.\nServe curd sandwiches plain or accompanied with some potato chips or banana wafers. You can also serve these dahi sandwiches with any dip or sauce of your choice.\nIf you are looking for more Sandwich recipes then do check:\nColeslaw sandwich\nClub sandwich\nCheese sandwich\nMayonnaise sandwich\nCucumber sandwich\nSTEP BY STEP PHOTOS ABOVE Many of my recipes have detailed step by step photos and useful tips to help you make it easily and perfectly.\nPIN\nPRINT\nCurd Sandwich\n4.34 from 6 votes\nThis is a quick and easy curd sandwich recipe with a veggie curd filling.\nAuthor: Dassana Amit\nPrep Time: 10\nmins\nCook Time: 10\nmins\nTotal Time: 20\nmins\nCourse: breakfasts,snacks\nCuisine: world\nDiet: vegetarian\nServings (change the number to scale): 2\nto 3\n(1 CUP = 250 ML)\nIngredients\n\u00bc\ncup\nfinely chopped cabbage\n\u00bc\ncup\ntightly packed finely chopped or grated carrots\n\u00bc\ncup\nboiled or steamed corn kernels\n2\ntablespoons\nfinely chopped capsicum\n(bell pepper) - can use green or red or yellow bell pepper\n2\ntablespoons\nfinely chopped spring onions\nor onions\n\u2153\ncup\ngreek yogurt\nor thick curd or hung curd - 90 grams\n\u2153\nteaspoon\nblack pepper\nor add as required\nsome dried herbs like oregano\n, thyme, basil or mixed herbs, add as required\nred chili flakes\nor finely chopped green chilies, add as required\nsalt as required\nbutter as required\n8 to 10\nbread slices,\nwhole wheat or brown or multigrain or white bread\nInstructions\nmaking stuffing\nFirst rinse and finely chop the veggies in a food chopper or a food processor or with a knife.\nAdd \u2153 cup greek yogurt or thick curd or hung curd.\nSeason with \u2153 teaspoon black pepper or you can add as per taste.

Club sandwich is a type of sandwich that is popular. Here the sandwich fillings are stuffed in 3 to 4 layers. There are many ways a club sandwich can be made.\nThis recipe of club sandwich is similar to the veg club sandwiches that used to be served in restaurants in Mumbai. During our growing up years, we would relish this sandwich and it would be one of our frequent order in restaurants.\nGet My Secrets to Great Indian Food\nSign up for my FREE Beginners Guide to Delicious Indian Cooking\nThe fillings added in this veg club sandwich\u00a0is slightly different.\nBesan chilla \u00a0or Tomato omelette is used as one of the stuffing. There is a layer of cucumber, lettuce and tomato ( I have only added tomatoes and cucumber). The third layer is of cheese or grated veggies like cabbage and carrots mixed with mayonnaise or just plain cheese slices are used. I did not have mayonnaise, so I mixed grated veggies with cheese. You can also just use cheese slices.\nI make these club sandwiches on occasions and it is relished by everyone at home. They are pretty easy to prepare. I have used coriander chutney in the sandwiches, but you can skip it and use mayonnaise or a cheese spread. You can be innovative and make your own fillings for these sandwiches.\nThe bread is usually toasted and then the sandwiches are made. If you are not a fan of toasted bread as they become slightly dense on cooling, then you can directly place the sandwiches in a sandwich maker and toast or grill them. Or you can make them without toasting the bread.\nThese club sandwiches are filling and heavy . you can make them as kids evening snack or for small parties. Its best to serve them immediately.\nIf you are looking for more Sandwich recipes then do check:\nSandwich recipe\nGrilled sandwich\nColeslaw sandwich\nMayonnaise sandwich\nPaneer sandwich recipe\nCheese sandwich recipe\nSTEP BY STEP PHOTOS ABOVE Many of my recipes have detailed step by step photos and useful tips to help you make it easily and perfectly.\nPIN\nPRINT\nclub sandwich recipe\n4.75 from 12 votes\nVeg club sandwich recipe - this recipe is the club sandwich that used to be served in the restaurants in Mumbai.\u00a0\nAuthor: Dassana Amit\nPrep Time: 10\nmins\nCook Time: 20\nmins\nTotal Time: 30\nmins\nCourse: snacks\nCuisine: indian\nServings (change the number to scale): 3\nclub sandwiches\n(1 CUP = 250 ML)\nIngredients\nfor making besan chilla for club sandwich\n\u00bd\ncup\nbesan\n(gram flour)\n1\nsmall onion\n- chopped or about \u00bc cup finely chopped onions\n1\nsmall to medium tomato\n- chopped or \u2153 cup finely chopped tomatoes\n1\ntablespoon\nchopped coriander leaves\n(dhania patta)\n\u215b\nteaspoon\najwain\n(carom seeds)\n\u215b\nteaspoon\nturmeric powder\n(haldi)\n\u215b\nteaspoon\nred chili powder\n(lal mirch powder)\n\u215b\nteaspoon\ngaram masala powder\n\u2153\ncup\nwater\nor add as required\nsalt as per taste\noil as required\nfor first layer filling of club sandwich\n1\nmedium tomato\n- sliced\n1\nsmall to medium cucumber\n- sliced\nlettuce leaves as required\n- optional\nfor second layer filling of club sandwich\n\u2153\ncup\ngrated or minced cabbage\n(patta gobhi)\n\u2153\ncup\nfinely chopped capsicum\n(bell pepper or shimla mirch)\n\u2153\ncup\ngrated carrot\n(gajar)\n\u00bd\ncup\ngrated processed cheese\nor mayonnaise or half-half of mayonnaise and grated cheese\n1 to 2\ntablespoons\ncream\n- optional\n\u00bc\nteaspoon\nblack pepper powder\n(kali mirch powder)\n1\npinch\nsalt\n- optional\nfor making sandwich chutney\n1\ncup\ntightly packed coriander leaves\nor \u00bd cup each of mint leaves and coriander leaves\n\u00bd\nteaspoon\nchaat masala powder\n1 or 2\ngreen chilies\n- chopped\n1 to 2\nteaspoon\nwater for grinding\n- optional\nother ingredients of club sandwich\n12\nbread slices\n1\nsmall bowl of sandwich chutney\nbutter as required\nInstructions\npreparing sandwich chutney\nRinse coriander leaves very well with water.\nThen in a grinder take 1 cup tightly packed coriander leaves, \u00bd teaspoon chaat masala powder, 1 to 2 green chilies (chopped), salt.

Pav sandwich is yet another scrumptious snack from the Mumbai street food scene. Pav or bread rolls are used an accompaniment with many snacks in Mumbai. They are served with curries like usal or misal\u00a0(legumes curry) or snacks like kanda bhaji or aloo pakora or samosa.\nThere are various ways pav sandwich can be made . in this recipe a spiced mashed potatoes stuffing is placed in the pav along with some sliced veggies.\nGet My Secrets to Great Indian Food\nSign up for my FREE Beginners Guide to Delicious Indian Cooking\nI have lightly toasted the pav in a bit of butter before placing the fillings in them. Alternatively you can place the stuffing and then toast or grill the pav.\nWhile growing up,\u00a0 Pav bhaji , Vada pav and Samosa pav were my favorite snacks with pav. Eating vada pav and samosa pav was easier as you just need to hold them in your hands and while walking on road you can eat them. Thats what I would do when coming from my tuition classes.

made with spiced potato toppings and spicy namkeen mixture. it is a popular street food recipe in india and is mainly served as a evening snacks with cup of tea or coffee. the recipe is easy and simple to make without any complex ingredients required, and also best way to finish leftover bread slices.\naloo toast recipe | aloo bread toast | aloo toast sandwich with step by step photo and video recipe. indian street food has evolved from the traditional deep fried snacks to sandwich and toast. these street style toast follow the traditional way of toasting the bread slices, but spice it up with local ingredients. one such popular and attractive bread toast recipe is aloo toast recipe made with aloo masala.\nwell many readers may have questions on how this recipe is different from my previous post of masala toast recipe. if you have noticed, in this recipe i have toasted the bread with aloo masala as its topping. basically there isn\u2019t any stuffing of spice masala in between 2 bread slices like any traditional sandwich recipe. whereas in masala toast the same spiced mashed veggies are stuffed in between and toasted on open tawa . i personally prefer the sandwich way of this recipe, but the aloo toast is much easier and simpler. moreover the toast recipe looks more attractive and presentable compared to sandwich. anyway, both recipes are ideal snack and you can make as per your preferences.\nfurthermore, i would like to highlight some of the tips, variations and suggestions while making this aloo toast recipe . firstly, i would heavily recommend to use white sandwich bread slices and avoid other flavours of bread. as matter of fact you can use the pav bread too make this recipe too. you may have to slice it horizontally before using it. secondly, i have used bombay mixture to spice it up on top of the toast bread. you should get it in most of the indian grocery store. but you can also use kerala spice mixture which is considered more spicier than bombay mixture. finally the toast has to be served immediately once it is prepared. you can make the masala in advance and assemble it whenever it is required.\nfinally, i would like to conclude by highlighting my other sandwich and toast recipes collection with this post of aloo toast recipe . it includes recipes like aloo sandwich , masala toast , cheese toast masala , cheese dabeli ,

It took me less than 10 minutes to assemble and pack them. The combo of plain bread and amul butter tasted so good. And also black pepper. Since I had to pack them for 8 hours duration, I didn\u2019t add tomato as I thought they would get sullen. Will cucumber stay good for that long? Since I skipped veggies, we had the sandwiches with ketchup but they still tasted very nice. Thank you.\ndassana amit\nSep 19, 2017\nthank you ruchi. in 8 hours cucumber and tomato will soften and taste different too. whenever we travel, i do make tomato-cucumber sandwiches, but we have them in about 4 hours. as you mentioned bread, butter with some black pepper also tastes good. sometimes i just make bread, butter with some black pepper and chaat masala and this also tastes good.\nmenu\nHome\nRecipes Index\nBy Ingredients\nBhindi (Okra)\nBrinjal (Eggplant)\nCabbage\nCapsicum\nCauliflower\nChickpeas\nFenugreek\nMushroom\nPaneer Recipes\nGreen Peas\nSpinach\nPotato\nBy Indian Cuisine\nAndhra Recipes\nBengali Recipes\nGoan Recipes\nGujarati Recipes\nHyderabadi Recipes\nKarnataka Recipes\nKashmiri Recipes\nKerala Recipes\nKonkan Recipes\nMaharashtrian Recipes\nNorth Indian Food\nPunjabi Recipes\nSouth Indian Food\nUttar Pradesh Cuisine\nTamil Nadu Recipes\nBreakfast\nEasy Breakfast\nIdli\nDosa Varieties\nParatha Recipes\nSnacks\nStarters & Snacks\nStreet Food\nEvening Snacks\nBread Snacks\nPakora Recipes\nSandwich Recipes\nSweets & Desserts\nBurfi (Fudge)\nCookies\nDesserts\nEggless Cakes\nIce Cream\nHalwa Recipes\nKheer and Payasam\nLadoo Recipes\nSweets\nBeverages\nBeverages\nJuices\nMilkshakes\nSmoothie\nTea & Coffee\nRice\nIndian Rice Recipes\nPulao Recipes\nBiryani Varieties\nMain Course\nVegetables\nCurry\nDal (Lentils) & Legumes\nSambar\nPasta Recipes\nPizza Recipes\nIndian Breads\nIndian Chinese\nBread Recipes\nInstant Pot\nAccompaniments\nChutney Recipes\nPickles\nRaita Recipes\nSalad Recipes\nRasam Varieties\nSoup Recipes\nSpecial Diet\nVegan Recipes\nGluten Free Recipes\nLow Fat Recipes\nSatvik \u2013 No Onion NO Garlic\nNavratri & Fasting Recipes\nDIY\nSpice Mix\nCondiment\nDIY\nAbout\nfree email series\nGet My Secrets to Great Indian Food\nSign up for my FREE Beginners Guide to Delicious Indian Cooking\nFIND A RECIPE\nSearch for:\nNamaste.

Tasty grilled sandwiches made with a spiced rajma stuffing. Rajma beans are kidney beans.\nSharing a simple and tasty rajma sandwich that is liked by everyone . usually when I cook rajma or chana, I cook\u00a0some\u00a0extra, so that I can make sandwiches from them. For this recipe, I have shown the complete method of soaking and cooking rajma. If you have leftover Rajma recipe \u00a0or chana masala, then you can even make sandwiches with them. The consistency of the rajma masala or chana masala has to be dry or semi-dry to make sandwiches.\nGet My Secrets to Great Indian Food\nSign up for my FREE Beginners Guide to Delicious Indian Cooking\nBoth rajma sandwiches and Chana sandwiches are heavy and filling. They keep you full for some time.\nFor some crunch in the sandwiches , I have added capsicum (bell pepper). You can even add grated carrots or beetroots. Even a mix of some onions, tomatoes and capsicum can be added. Veggies can be skipped too. I have also added grated cheese, which can be given a skip.\nThis rajma sandwich can be toasted too . you can toast the sandwiches in a sandwich maker, oven or a tawa (pan). If using tawa, you can check this recipe on preparing a grilled sandwich on tawa \u2013 How to make grilled sandwich on tawa .\nServe grilled rajma sandwiches with tomato ketchup or chilli sauce.\nHow to make rajma sandwich\nPressure cooking rajma\n1. Rinse \u00bd cup rajma or red kidney beans (125 grams) first a couple of times. Then soak in enough water for 7 to 8 hours or overnight. Next day drain all the soaked water and rinse the rajma beans very well in fresh water.\n2.add them in a pressure cooker along with 1.5 cups water.\n3.\u00a0pressure cook rajma on a medium flame for 12 to 13 minutes or till the rajma beans are cooked well.\n4.\u00a0there should not be any bite in the beans. Depending on the quality of beans, they may take less or more time to cook. Drain the water and keep aside.\nPreparing rajma Stuffing\n5. Heat 1 tablespoon butter or oil in a pan or kadai.\n6. Add \u00bd teaspoon cumin seeds and saute till the cumin seeds splutter.\n7. Then add\u00a0\u2153 cup chopped onions.\n8. Saute till the onions turn light brown.\n9. Then add 1 teaspoon ginger-garlic paste.\n10. Saute till the raw aroma of both ginger and garlic goes away.\n11. Keep the flame to a low and then add \u00bc teaspoon turmeric powder, \u00bd teaspoon Kashmiri red chili powder, \u00bd teaspoon coriander powder and\u00a01 teaspoon pav bhaji masala [add \u00bd teaspoon garam masala + \u00bc teaspoon amchur powder (dry mango powder) if you do not have pav bhaji masala].\n12.

If you want you can add some more amchur powder.\nAssembling and grilling rajma sandwiches\n18. Spread butter on bread slices. I have used Whole wheat bread as a healthier alternative. You can also use Brown , multi grain or White bread . you can skip spreading butter if you want. Add the rajma stuffing on the bread slices.\n19. Top up with some chopped capsicum. You can also add onion slices, tomato slices, grated carrots or beetroot.\n20. Add some grated cheddar cheese. You can also add grated paneer instead of cheese.\n21.

Pretty easy and simple to make. Tomatoes and cheese pair very well in any recipe.\nGet My Secrets to Great Indian Food\nSign up for my FREE Beginners Guide to Delicious Indian Cooking\nUsually, I toast or grill these sandwiches in an electric toaster or grill. In the post I have shown how to grill the sandwich on a tawa. So if you do not have toaster or grill, then also you can easily make these sandwiches on a tawa (skillet) or pan.\nServe these tomato cheese sandwiches with any dip or tomato sauce or chutney. You can also accompany some potato chips or banana wafers\u00a0or potato wedges\u00a0by the side.\nHow to make cheese and tomato sandwich\n1. Firstly take the slices of bread and spread some butter on them. You can use Wheat bread or multi grain bread or Brown bread or White bread .\n2. Then place 3 to 4 slices of tomatoes.\n3. Add grated cheddar cheese. You can add less or more as per your requirements. But do not add too much or over stuff with cheese and then the cheese melts on tawa and makes a mess.\n4. Sprinkle, dried herbs like oregano and basil. You can also use dried mix herbs. Also sprinkle some black pepper powder or freshly crushed black pepper\u00a0and\u00a0red chili flakes. You can also sprinkle some salt if you want.\n5. Cover with the second buttered slice.\n6. Heat a pan or tawa and brush some butter on it.\n7. Place the tomato and cheese sandwich on the tawa and gently move it around so that it soaks up the butter.\n8. Place a plate or lid on it. On top of the plate place a heavy weight like mortar or a heavy bowl. Or you could just use a heavy plate or tray.\n9. When the bottom bread is grilled well, then remove the lid and heavy weight. Brush some butter on top side. With this method the sandwiches get grilled fast, so do check with a spatula if the bottom bread is grilled well or not.\n10. With a spatula turn over the sandwich. You will see the crisp and grilled\u00a0side facing you.\n11. Place the lid and heavy weight again and grill\u00a0till the bottom bread is golden.\n12. Remove and serve grilled cheese and tomato sandwich hot or warm.\nYou can serve these tomato and cheese sandwiches with any dip or sauce or chutney. You can also accompany some veg nuggets or french fries by the side.\nFew more snacks recipes you may like are:\nCheese sandwich\nCheese chilli toast\nCheese breadsticks\nMayonnaise sandwich\nTomato cucumber sandwich\nSTEP BY STEP PHOTOS ABOVE Many of my recipes have detailed step by step photos and useful tips to help you make it easily and perfectly.\nPIN\nPRINT\nTomato and cheese sandwich\n5 from 1 vote\nThese yum grilled cheese and tomato sandwich can be easily made in a tawa or pan.

You can use cheese slices. I don\u2019t use because we don\u2019t like the taste of cheese slices. The difference in the various types of cheese is the preparation and method and the culturing.

I have also added steamed corn kernels. Instead of corn kernels you can also add steamed or boiled green peas. Do note that all the veggies are raw except the steamed corn kernels. If you want you can blanch the cabbage leaves. I used the store brought eggless mayonnaise to make the coleslaw. You can use homemade too if you have it. I usually do not grill these sandwiches, but you can toast or grill them if you want.\nBasically coleslaw is a cabbage salad which is said to have originated from Netherlands. It has a mayonnaise dressing and in some instances, sour cream is also added.\nColeslaw sandwich makes for a good light breakfast or brunch or snack. You can serve them plain or accompany them with some french fries or potato wedges. These sandwiches also make nice finger food for parties.\nHow to make coleslaw sandwich\n1. First rinse and finely chop the veggies in a food chopper or a food processor or with a knife. You will need \u00bc cup finely chopped cabbage, \u00bc cup tightly packed finely chopped carrots,\u00a02 tablespoons finely chopped capsicum and\u00a02 tablespoons finely chopped spring onions or onions. Also add \u00bc cup boiled or steamed corn kernels. You can skip corn if you want.\n2. Mix the veggies.\n3. Then add \u00bc cup mayonnaise. You can use eggless or vegan mayonnaise.\n4. Now add \u00bc to \u00bd teaspoon black pepper powder, a pinch of salt and\u00a01 teaspoon sugar. I usually make these sandwiches slightly sweet. If you want you can add less sugar. Addition of sugar also depends on the sweetness in the mayonnaise sauce. So you can even skip sugar or add very less depending on the sweetness of the mayonnaise sauce you are using.\n5. Then add \u00bd teaspoon lemon juice. If you want, you can also add some red chili flakes or some dried herbs like oregano, thyme, basil. For a spicy taste, you can add 1 green chili (finely chopped). I have made these sandwiches with green chilies for myself and they taste good.\n6. Mix everything very well. Check the taste and add some more salt, sugar or black pepper if required.\n7. Take the bread slices and spread some butter on them. This is an optional step. I have used Wheat bread . you can use any bread of your choice.\n8. Now spread\u00a0veg coleslaw stuffing on the\u00a0bread slices.\n9. Place on top the remaining buttered slices and slice the sandwiches in rectangles or triangles or small squares. If you want you can even toast or grill these sandwiches.\n10.

burger recipe | vegetarian burger | veg cheese burger\nBy\nHebbars Kitchen\n-\nOctober 8, 2019\nveggie burger recipe | vegetarian burger | veg cheese burger with detailed photo and video recipe. an easy and quick healthy burger option made with mixed veggie patties and cheese slice. it is an ideal quick and healthy meal and can be served for morning breakfast, lunch, dinner and also a snack. the recipe follows basic vegetable toppings and dressing as practised in indian street food outlets to make it more effective.\nveggie burger recipe | vegetarian burger | veg cheese burger with step by step photo and video recipe. burger or sandwich recipes have been ultra-popular especially in urban indian cities. even though the burger and sandwich recipes are popularly served as a snack by much fast food vendor, but also gaining popularity for breakfast and lunch. one such simple and healthy burger recipe is the veggie burger recipe made with veggie patties.\nas i explained earlier, i have used a minimal approach when it comes to the vegetable toppings. as a matter of fact, i have used only sliced cucumber and tomato slices in terms of vegetable. i was planning to use sliced beetroot slices, lettuce and also boiled potato slices. but at the same time, i wanted to make something like street food. hence i finalised with the above 2 veggies. in addition, i also added pickled jalapeno , which is not a mandatory option, but would add the salty, sour taste to it. having said that, i have added all the necessary spices and flavour to the patty and it should be sufficient for this burger. to the patty mixture, i have added chaat masala which should supply the flavours for a street style veg burger.\nfurthermore, i would like to conclude with few tips, suggestions and variations for a perfect veggie burger recipe . firstly, i have used store-bought burger buns for this recipe and you can use any desired burger bun for it. in addition you can also use pav bread or even sandwich bread slices for this recipe. secondly, the patties are multipurpose and you can use it for roll, paratha and also for chaat recipes. lastly, the shape and thickness of the patties are completely optional and you can shape it to any desired shape or thickness. i personally like thick and meaty patties in my burger, but it is completely optional.\nfinally, i request you to check my other sandwich recipes collection with this post of veggie burger recipe . it mainly includes recipes like bombay veg sandwich , aloo tikki burger , pinwheel sandwich , pizza sandwich , veg sandwich , mayonnaise sandwich , cheese sandwich , masala toast \u2013 iyengar bakery style , bombay veg grilled sandwich , mayonnaise cheese sandwich . further, to these i would also like to highlight my other

But yes on rare occasions due to time constraints, I do buy whole wheat or multi-grain loaf from outside. On a side note, I will be adding some more variety of bread recipes as I do get a lot of requests for various types of bread recipes.\nThis whole wheat sandwich bread is similar to the Wheat bread i had posted earlier. With just using whole wheat flour and yeast, you can get a nicely soft textured sandwich bread. I do not use vital wheat gluten as I am not comfortable adding it to breads. I might as well use some all purpose flour instead.\nTips for making sandwich bread\nDepending on the quality of flour, you can add less or more water.\nInstead of sugar, you can use jaggery. If you want, you can reduce the sugar to 2 to 3 teaspoons. Avoid adding honey as a sweetener, as honey becomes toxic when heated.\nYou can also use dry active yeast or fresh yeast. Measurements are given in the ingredient list above. With both dry active yeast and fresh yeast the leavening time will increase for the first and second rise.\nThis recipe does not use vital wheat gluten or any other agent to help make the bread soft. You just need to knead the dough well. A tiny amount of lemon juice added in the dough helps in the gluten development and this gives a soft & light crumb in the bread. The heaviness or denseness is not felt in the bread. Thus making it very good for sandwiches.\nYou can make plain, toast or grilled sandwiches with this whole wheat sandwich bread. Since no milk product is used in the bread, the bread can be easily freezed or stored for more than a week in the refrigerator.\nThe recipe yields one loaf , but you can even double the recipe and make two loafs. If you have a stand mixer, then you can use it to knead the dough.\nI had made the dough in the evening. After the second rise, I kept the dough in the fridge and baked the bread in the morning. If you want you can also follow this method. Keeping the dough overnight in the fridge helps in better leavening. The method uses the sponge method and then the dough is kneaded. So there is some waiting time between leavening the sponge and then for the two rises.\nI have also used instant yeast. You can even use fresh yeast or dry active yeast . Do note that will fresh yeast and dry active yeast, the rising time of the bread will increase . with this whole wheat sandwich bread you can make any sandwich or bread snacks recipes.\nHow to make sandwich bread\n1. Add \u00bd teaspoon instant yeast & 1 tablespoon sugar in 1 cup warm water. Stir and mix very well. The water should be lukewarm and not even slightly hot or on the cooler side.\n2. Then add\u00a01.5 cups whole wheat flour.\n3. Mix the flour in the water+yeast solution very well.\u00a0cover and let this mixture sit for 45 minutes to an hour.\n4. Here is the sponge mixture after 50 minutes.\n5.\u00a0when you stir the mixture, you will see that it has leavened very well. With small tiny air pockets in it.\n6.\u00a0now add\u00a02 tablespoons oil and\u00a01 teaspoon salt to this sponge mixture. Mix again with a spoon.\n7. Add 1.5 cups whole wheat flour.\n8. Add 1 tablespoon lemon juice. If you do not have lemon juice, you can use\u00a01 tablespoon vinegar or butter milk or curd. If using vinegar, then use regular white vinegar or apple cider vinegar.\n9. Begin to mix and then knead the dough for 8 to 10 minutes. You can also use a stand mixer for kneading the dough.\n10. Knead to a smooth soft dough.\u00a0now flatten and keep the dough in the same bowl or in another bowl. \u00a0cover with a lid and keep for the first rise for 45 minutes to 1 hour. The dough is slightly sticky . if the dough feels too sticky, then you can add some more flour and knead. I have not added any water later. In case the dough looks dry and stiff, then you can add some water.\n11. A pic below of the dough after 55 minutes.\n12. Lightly knead the dough again.\nShaping sandwich bread\n13. Make into a log shape.\n14. Place the log shaped dough in a well-greased loaf pan. Allow for the second rise for 30 to 45 minutes.\n15. A below pic of the dough after 32 minutes. I did not bake after the second rise. I kept the dough in the fridge.\u00a0i sealed the pan with an aluminium foil and then covered it with a kitchen cotton towel and kept the pan in the fridge.\n16. The dough next day. You can see the difference in the way the loaf has risen and has covered the whole area of the pan as compared to the above pic. So if you have time you can follow this method. But do cover the pan well, so that the dough does not dry out in the fridge.\n17. Now make a diagonal slit on the dough, not more than \u00bc inch deep. This will give the dough more room for expansion while baking.\n18. Sprinkle some sesame seeds and gently press them so that they stick on the dough loaf.\nBaking sandwich bread\n19. Bake the loaf in a preheated oven at 200 degrees celsius with the only bottom heating element on. The preheating time is 20 minutes. Keep the loaf in the center rack.\n20. Bake sandwich bread for 30 to 40 mins or till the tops and sides are golden. Also on tapping the bread, it should sound hollow. In my oven it took 38 minutes for the sandwich bread to bake.\n21. After 5 to 6 minutes, gently remove the bread loaf from the pan.\n22. Keep the sandwich loaf on a wired rack for it to cool down at room temperature. If not using the sandwich bread immediately, then once it is cooled, you can keep it in a bread box or in an airtight container. If living in a warm and humid climate, then I suggest to refrigerate or freeze the loaf.\n23. Slice the sandwich bread and you can make sandwiches . or use it for your regular toasts with butter or jam or any spread or dip. I made guacamole sandwiches with the whole wheat sandwich loaf.\nMore bread recipes for you!\nPita bread\nBrown bread\nWhite bread\nPizza recipe\nBanana bread\nSTEP BY STEP PHOTOS ABOVE Many of my recipes have detailed step by step photos and useful tips to help you make it easily and perfectly.\nPIN\nPRINT\nSandwich Bread\n5 from 4 votes\nThis is a soft sandwich bread made from whole wheat flour.\nAuthor: Dassana Amit\nPrep Time: 2\nhrs\nCook Time: 35\nmins\nTotal Time: 2\nhrs\n35\nmins\nCourse: breakfasts\nCuisine: world\nDiet: vegan,vegetarian\nServings (change the number to scale): 12\nslices\n(1 CUP = 250 ML)\nIngredients\nfor sponge\n1\ncup\nwarm water,\n250 ml or add as required\n\u00bd\nteaspoon\ninstant yeast\nor \u00be teaspoon dry active yeast or \u00bd tablespoon fresh yeast\n1\ntablespoon\nsugar\n1.5\ncups\nwhole wheat flour\n, 180 grams\nto be added later\n1.5\ncups\nwhole wheat flour\n, 180 grams\n2\ntablespoons\noil\n- i added sunflower oil\n1\nteaspoon\nsalt\nor add as required\n1\ntablespoon\nlemon juice,\ncan also add vinegar or buttermilk or curd\nInstructions\npreparing sponge\nAdd \u00bd teaspoon instant yeast & & 1 tablespoon sugar in 1 cup warm water.

If yes, what and how much?\ndassana amit\nJan 07, 2018\nthere is no substitute. soda breads are there but the texture is very different.\nGarima\nDec 11, 2017\nHi Dassana,\nI am planning to bake a bread for the first time and what better recipe to follow than yours. Frankly, I am very scared but anyway could you tell for a beginner like me which recipe should I try first 100% whole wheat or whole wheat sandwich. What is the difference between the two. Thanks for helping me out every time.\ndassana amit\nDec 11, 2017\nthanks garima. try whole wheat sandwich as in this method sponge technique is used, which gives very good texture and also the chance of anything going wrong is very less or minimal. the recipe shared is made with instant yeast. if you use fresh yeast or dry active yeast, then the timing for first rise and second rise will double or triple and this depends on the temperature conditions. also if using instant yeast, then do make sure that it is instant yeast. some brands in india label dry active yeast as instant yeast as this causes a lot of confusion. a way to distinguish between both is that instant yeast has granules similar to the size of poppy seeds (khus khus) and dry active yeast has granules which are slightly bigger and resemble yellow mustard seeds.\nGarima\nDec 12, 2017\nThanks a ton Dassana. Anyplace I can get instant yeast online (if you know)?\ndassana amit\nDec 12, 2017\ngarima, check on amazon.in. you should get some other brand there. check the reviews before buying.\nArpita t\nSep 24, 2017\nmy bread doesn\u2019t become spongy from inside. it becomes bati like in texture from centre and hard on top\ndassana amit\nSep 24, 2017\nthats due to the bread dough not getting leavened and the cause here is the yeast not getting proofed well or poor quality of yeast. dissolve yeast in lukewarm water+sugar solution for 10 to 15 minutes. the solution should become frothy and bubbly. if not then discard this solution and make again.\nAkansha\nAug 03, 2017\nHi My oven doesn\u2019t have a setting where i can select only the bottom heating element. Should i cover the top of the bread with butter paper from the starting and let it bake as usual with both the heating elements? Thanks\ndassana amit\nAug 03, 2017\nyes you can do this way. after baking the top will not be that browned. so during the last part of baking, for some more browning, you can remove the butter paper and bake till the top gets browned.\nrashmi bahety\nJul 11, 2017\nhello mam \u2026 one question from where do I these kind of loaf tins and please guide me about dimensions of loaf tins also\ndassana amit\nJul 13, 2017\nrashmi, you can search on amazon.in. try to buy a metal one. they come in different dimensions depending upon the type of load you want to make small, medium or large. the one which i have give a regular medium sized loaf. i don\u2019t know the dimension.\nAnuradha\nMay 29, 2017\nHi Dassana, I love all your north indian gravy recipes. Every dish I have made is a success. I\u2019m very new to baking & would like to try this recipe. If I want to half the recipe, do I still bake for around 40 mins? Or will the baking time reduce?\ndassana amit\nMay 30, 2017\nthanks anuradha. if you halve the recipe, then the baking time will reduce. so it can be around 20 to 30 minutes.\nAnuradha\nMay 30, 2017\nThanks a lot. I\u2019ll try this & let you know how it turns out.\ndassana amit\nMay 30, 2017\nWelcome Anuradha. Yes do share your feedback.\nSomya Jain\nApr 20, 2017\nHi Dassana, I am a big fan of your blog. I always look up at your website for any recipe. Your recipes are a big hit at my home. I tried whole wheat sandwich bread but it didn\u2019t come out soft. It was dense and outer crust was hard.Until the second rise, it was good. When I kept it in the fridge, loaf didn\u2019t rise in the fridge. Also, my mixture was not as spongy as yours. It was bit dry.Could you please let me know the reason for dense bread. Appreciate your help if you can give me any tips for next time. Thanks\ndassana amit\nApr 20, 2017\nthanks somya for the positive words. bread coming out dense is most of the times due to the yeast not getting activated or the yeast solution not proofing well. the yeast solution not proofing well is due to the quality of yeast. some indian brands of yeast do not give a bubbly and frothy solution. as a result the bread dough does rise, but does not rise well. the sponginess is also because of the same reason. since the dough was not leavened well, the outer dough also has become hard. another point is add water as required. even as slightly sticky dough is fine. kneading is also important. the dough has to be kneaded very well. try with a good quality of yeast like gloripan/mauripan or red star or any good brand.\nNeeta\nDec 31, 2016\nHello Dassana! I like that this recipe uses minimum ingredients and it looks amazing. Thanks for sharing \ud83d\ude42 I have a question: \u2014 I buy Sujata multi grain atta to make rotis. Can I use that to make this bread?\ndassana amit\nJan 01, 2017\nneeta, with multi grain atta, the texture becomes dense. for multigrain atta, the proportion of whole wheat flour should be more as compared to other flours to reduce the denseness. then you can use the multigrain atta. whole wheat flour has gluten which is responsible for the texture in bread. gluten is not present in other millet and lentil flours. thats why the multi grain bread becomes dense. some maida or more wheat flour or gluten powder needs to be added in the dough.\nAsifa\nDec 28, 2016\nHi Dassana I am a big admirer of your blog since two years.

First of all thanks a ton for this amazing platform & most amazing simple to follow recipes.\nI baked the bread. Left it overnight outside the refrigerator because the temperature in Delhi is quite low. Didn\u2019t have loaf pan so kept it on the bake tray n baked.\nIt\u2019s outer covering has come out hard & inside portion is soft but not spongy. Bottom is harder than upper bit. Placed it in the middle rack. Where could I have gone wrong? The\nRidhi\nNov 29, 2016\nAlso it\u2019s upper layer had big crack. \ud83d\ude41\ndassana amit\nNov 29, 2016\nwelcome ridhi. since you have not used loaf pan, thats the reason the outer covering has become hard. the loaf pan gives structure to the loaf and hence the texture is even, if everything else has been followed correctly. in the third rise, did you shape the dough as a loaf. this shaping should be correctly done and should be tight, when placed in the pan. as here also the dough rises again. if the shaping is not done correctly, the texture of the bread does not come out well. in the absence of loaf pan, you can always make bread rolls or pav. just roll and shape them into rounds, place them with 1 to 2 inches apart from each other. cover and let them rise. then you can bake them.\nRidhi\nNov 30, 2016\nThanks for your response. I did shape it as a rectangle to the best possible capacity. Could this hardening be possible because of over baking? What is the reason of the crack on the upper layer?\ndassana amit\nNov 30, 2016\nhardening could be due to a few reasons. one of them is over baking. another reason would be the dough has not been kneaded very well. yet another reason could be that the dough is slight dry or does not have enough moisture in it. a fourth reason could be that the yeast has not proofed well which has in turn not leavened the dough very well. cracks can be due to dryness in the dough or due to over baking or due to temperature fluctuations in the oven \u2013 which means opening the oven door many times. so while baking anything including breads or cakes, do not open the door during atleast during the first half of the baking. the oven also has to be preheated for 15 to 20 minutes before you place the pan in it.\nRidhi\nNov 30, 2016\nThanks so much! Will take care of these next time. You are superb!\ndassana amit\nNov 30, 2016\nwelcome ridhi \ud83d\ude42\nSeema\nNov 26, 2016\nHi I tried this recipe today, taste was good but the outer cover turned out to be a bit hard, can you tell me what would have gone wrong\ndassana amit\nNov 26, 2016\nthe outer crust had got baked too much. since the timing varies from oven to oven, it could be that the time taken to bake is faster in your oven. so whenever baking, always check the time as per the oven you have. no two oven bakes at the same time. next time you can reduce the time for baking. also if the pan is kept close to the top heating element, the the outer crust will get hard. in this case, covering the pan with a foil helps the crust not to get overdone.\nTina\nNov 21, 2016\nThanks\u2026 Finally I made wit n it turned out well\u2026how can I give you a picture\ndassana amit\nNov 21, 2016\nthanks tina. you can send me the pic at [email\u00a0protected]\nSyama\nNov 19, 2016\nHi Dasanna, great recipes.

Baking your eggless cakes at home makes me so happy. My heartfelt thanks to you for your efforts and hard work in making this blog a special place.\nI tried this wholewheat bread recipe yesterday using instant yeast. Everything was fine till i kept the dough in the fridge overnight. Early morning the dough had not risen and seemed to have deflated a bit. Unable to understand the reason for the same. After the first rise you had mentioned to lightly knead the dough and make into a log. I think maybe the kneading was not correctly done and i would have applied more pressure. Is that the reason, Please help.\nThanks and Regards Lathika\ndassana amit\nNov 18, 2016\nthanks much lathika. did you keep the dough in the fridge after the second rise? if its kept after the second rise, then it should not get deflated. also i hope you did not cover the top firmly and tightly. then the top will get pressed and thus deflate slightly. the foil has to be loosely sealed on the top. if the kneading is not done correctly, then also it affects the leavening. what i suggest is remove the dough from the pan. knead again. then shape into a log and keep it outside for some minutes till it rises. about 20 to 25 minutes. then bake in a preheated oven.\nTina\nNov 14, 2016\nCan you please tell me which wheat flour you use? The reason I also is cause I once used the regular roti atta for muffins\u2026though they turned out great couldn\u2019t take the wheat smell n taste really\u2026 So i want to be sure and avoid using white flour.\ndassana amit\nNov 14, 2016\ntina, i use organic atta flour. i usually use 24 letter mantra chakki ground atta or organic india whole wheat flour. i make breads, cakes and muffin often with flours from these two brands. the organic india whole wheat flour also gives very soft chapatis and parathas. whatever products i buy from organic garden \u2013 all are good. even their besan and basmati rice is good.\nPavani\nNov 13, 2016\nHi, can we use convection microwave for making this?\ndassana amit\nNov 13, 2016\npavani, you can use the convection mode of microwave oven. then bake at 190 or 200 degrees celsius. also if the top starts browning fast, then cover the bread with aluminium foil and continue to bake.\nPAWAN KUMAR\nNov 13, 2016\nI loved this recipe of making bread at home at it will be more hyegenic and yumy . i am going to try this myself.\ndassana amit\nNov 13, 2016\nthanks.\nArchana P Bansal\nNov 13, 2016\nI just loved the way you explained the entire recipe\u2026..specially the oven part \u2026..please keep posting more bread and loaf making recipes\u2026..i love baking bread \u2026\ndassana amit\nNov 13, 2016\nthanks a lot archana for the lovely feedback. i will be adding more bread recipes.\nmenu\nHome\nRecipes Index\nBy Ingredients\nBhindi (Okra)\nBrinjal (Eggplant)\nCabbage\nCapsicum\nCauliflower\nChickpeas\nFenugreek\nMushroom\nPaneer Recipes\nGreen Peas\nSpinach\nPotato\nBy Indian Cuisine\nAndhra Recipes\nBengali Recipes\nGoan Recipes\nGujarati Recipes\nHyderabadi Recipes\nKarnataka Recipes\nKashmiri Recipes\nKerala Recipes\nKonkan Recipes\nMaharashtrian Recipes\nNorth Indian Food\nPunjabi Recipes\nSouth Indian Food\nUttar Pradesh Cuisine\nTamil Nadu Recipes\nBreakfast\nEasy Breakfast\nIdli\nDosa Varieties\nParatha Recipes\nSnacks\nStarters & Snacks\nStreet Food\nEvening Snacks\nBread Snacks\nPakora Recipes\nSandwich Recipes\nSweets & Desserts\nBurfi (Fudge)\nCookies\nDesserts\nEggless Cakes\nIce Cream\nHalwa Recipes\nKheer and Payasam\nLadoo Recipes\nSweets\nBeverages\nBeverages\nJuices\nMilkshakes\nSmoothie\nTea & Coffee\nRice\nIndian Rice Recipes\nPulao Recipes\nBiryani Varieties\nMain Course\nVegetables\nCurry\nDal (Lentils) & Legumes\nSambar\nPasta Recipes\nPizza Recipes\nIndian Breads\nIndian Chinese\nBread Recipes\nInstant Pot\nAccompaniments\nChutney Recipes\nPickles\nRaita Recipes\nSalad Recipes\nRasam Varieties\nSoup Recipes\nSpecial Diet\nVegan Recipes\nGluten Free Recipes\nLow Fat Recipes\nSatvik \u2013 No Onion NO Garlic\nNavratri & Fasting Recipes\nDIY\nSpice Mix\nCondiment\nDIY\nAbout\nfree email series\nGet My Secrets to Great Indian Food\nSign up for my FREE Beginners Guide to Delicious Indian Cooking\nFIND A RECIPE\nSearch for:\nNamaste.

bread recipe | bread pizza recipe with instant pizza sauce\nBy\nHebbars Kitchen\n-\nApril 9, 2020\npizza bread recipe | bread pizza with instant pizza sauce with detailed photo and video recipe. an easy and tasty indian snack hack to satisfy the pizza thirst in a quick and efficient way. moreover, the recipe does not require a traditional pizza sauce and is made with a combination of tomato sauce and chilli sauce with mixed herbs and chilli flakes. it is a perfect evening snack which can be made within minutes and also an ideal recipe to finish any leftover bread slices.\npizza bread recipe | bread pizza with instant pizza sauce with step by step photo and video recipe. pizza recipes are still very new to indian audience but have taken over by storm particularly with younger generations. inevitably, it has to lead to many variation and innovations to meet the indian taste buds and also as tasty evening snack. one such easy and simple pizza recipe variation is bread pizza made with sandwich bread slice as its base with an instant pizza sauce.\nwell, this is my second attempt for the pizza bread recipe . in my first video post, i had used store-bought pizza sauce with same sandwich slices. i stared getting many requests to post the same recipe with an instant pizza sauce and not with traditional sauce. i can understand as most of the request has come from young couples or bachelors. hence i thought of coming up with something innovative yet effective pizza sauce. basically i have used easily available tomato ketchup sauce and mixed with chilli sauce for the extra zing. further, i have also added mixed herbs for the traditional flavour to the same sauce with some additional chilli flakes as toppings for extra spiciness. as a matter of fact, you can use the same instant pizza sauce for even traditional pizza base recipes. it may not offer the same flavour, but trust me you would not be dissatisfied with taste and overall experience.\nfurthermore, before wrapping up the recipe post, some easy and important tips, suggestions and variations to pizza bread recipe . firstly, do not attempt this recipe with other flavours of bread variations. i would heavily recommend using white sandwich bread slices. avoid bread variations like brown bread, wheat bread or multi-grain bread. secondly, with respect to adding vegetables, it is completely open-ended and you can add as per your preference. not to worry if you do not have jalapeno , olives but try to make it colourful to serve it to kids. lastly, while cooking or baking on tawa, make sure to apply a generous amount of butter before roasting. also ensure to keep flame very low, so that it doesn\u2019t get overcooked.\nfinally, i request you to check my other instant snacks recipes collection with this post of pizza bread recipe . it mainly includes recipes like chegodilu , aloo ke kabab , beetroot vadai , aloo paneer tikki , dal dhokla , corn vada , gulgula , suji snacks , batata vada , cabbage vada . further to these i would also like to highlight my other recipe categories like,\nsandwich recipes\nstreet food recipes\nparatha recipes\npizza bread video recipe:\nstreet

paratha recipe | bread chilla recipe | how to make bread parantha\nBy\nHebbars Kitchen\n-\nOctober 14, 2019\nbread paratha recipe | bread chilla recipe | how to make bread parantha with detailed photo and video recipe. an interesting flatbread paratha made with leftover bread slices and spices. the recipe is very quick and easy to make with the minimal and basic ingredients available in most of the indian kitchens. the dish is ideally made for morning breakfast, but can also be served lunch boxes and dinner with your choice of sides.\nbread paratha recipe | bread chilla recipe | how to make bread parantha with step by step photo and video recipe. paratha recipes are very basic indian flatbread recipe made across india made for myriad reasons. ideally it is made with boiled and spiced vegetables which are stuffed inside the wheat or plain flour dough. but this post is a unique parantha recipe made with leftover bread slices with vegetable toppings.\nwell, to be honest, i have made many recipes out of leftover bread slices. out of which most of them belong to snacks or deep-fried categories. i have posted very recipes which falls under the healthy breakfast section and i thought of sharing the bread paratha under that section. to be honest, i do not make the bread parantha regularly. i end up making either sandwich recipes or use the leftover bread slices for my dinner with a choice of curries. yet some times i end making these paratha\u2019s as i run out of options for my morning breakfast. basically it is not due to the fact that i have some leftover bread slices, but to make something new and break the monotonous breakfast regime.\nanyway, before concluding, i would like to add some tips, suggestions and variations for tasty bread paratha recipe . firstly, i would always recommend having white plain flour-based sandwich slices for any bread-based recipes. using multi-grain or wheat-based bread slices may give different taste. secondly, in terms of adding veggies, it is completely open-ended and you can experiment with your desired choices. i have added raw veggies and corn, but it can be further extended with other veggies. lastly, the paratha\u2019s has to be served immediately once it is rolled and fried. otherwise due to the gluten , it may turn chewy and also rubbery.\nfinally, i request you to check my other paratha recipes collection with this post of bread paratha recipe . it mainly includes recipes like namak mirch paratha , cabbage paratha , masala paratha , garlic paratha , tomato paratha , aloo paratha , parotta , pudina paratha , beetroot paratha , suji ka paratha . further, to these, i would also like to highlight my other recipes collection like,\npaneer recipes collection\nsandwich recipes collection\ncurry or sabji recipes

In my family, we have kids who love capsicum so much, that they don\u2019t mind taking capsicum every day in the tiffin.\nApart from making a dish completely with capsicum , one can also add them in sandwich or wrap or pizza stuffings, in pulao\u00a0and biryani with other veggies and even in simple dry sabzi or a gravy. I always buy capsicum when I do my grocery shopping as it is liked so much in the family and I always add them to the sandwiches or sabzis I make.\nGet My Secrets to Great Indian Food\nSign up for my FREE Beginners Guide to Delicious Indian Cooking\nI use all the three colored varieties of bell pepper that I get \u2013 red, yellow and green. Adding them not only makes the dish colorful but also tasty.\nSharing here a collection of 28 capsicum recipes I have posted on the website. I do make other varieties too and will add them in this collection whenever I share a recipe.\nCollection of 35 capsicum recipes\n1. Capsicum curry \u00a0 \u2013\u00a0\u00a0delicious Hyderabadi style curry made with bell peppers. Good side gravy dish with chapatis or parathas.\n2.
